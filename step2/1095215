1.d4 {Notes by Frank Marshall. Facing up to a tricky and
puzzling attack still remains a man-sized job over the board,
even though the subsequent annotations may demonstrate the
task an easy one.} d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Be7 5.e3 Nbd7
6.Rc1 c6 7.Nf3 O-O 8.Qc2 h6 9.Bh4 a6 10.a3 dxc4 {Giving up the
fight for the tempo. 10...b5 leads to a totally different type
of game.} 11.Bxc4 b5 12.Ba2 c5 13.Ne4 {The book line is 13
dxc5 Nxc5 14 Bb1 Re8. The text is no better in an objective
sense, but being a novelty, it gives my opponent more to think
about.} Qa5+ 14.Nfd2 cxd4 15.O-O {!? As will be seen, the
acceptance of the speculative pawn sacrifice is playable; but
the return of the pawn with 15...d3 is simpler.} dxe3 16.fxe3
Qb6 17.Nxf6+ Bxf6 {? This plausible move loses, whereas
17...Nxf6! would have left him with a satisfactory
defence. After the text, White's attack crashes through to
victory.} 18.Bb1 Rd8 19.Qh7+ Kf8 20.Qh8+ {!} Ke7 21.Qxg7 {!
The move that Black overlooked. With Black's king wandering in
the middle of the board, and with most of his pieces not
functioning, the result is a foregone conclusion.} Qxe3+
22.Kh1 Bxh4 {He has to take the bishop for better or worse,
for if 22...Qd4 (or ...Qe5) 23 Ne4 wins rapidly.} 23.Qxf7+ Kd6
24.Ne4+ Kd5 {Or 24...Ke5 25 Qg7+ winning.} 25.Qh5+ Bg5
{Amusing would be 25...e5 26 Qf7+ and wins or 25...Ne5 26
Rfd1+ etc.} 26.Qd1+ {!} Qd4 27.Qb3+ Ke5 28.Qg3+ Kd5 29.Qd6#
{The last five moves give a good idea of the queen's power.}
