1. e4 {Notes by J. Lowenthal} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 exd4 4. Bc4
Bc5 5. O-O {The accuracy with which Mr. Morphy opens his
games, when playing blindfold, is truly remarkable. The text
move here is much better than c3; for to that Black would
reply with ...Nf6 and resolve the game into the well known
Giuco Piano.} d6 {Correctly played and a better move than
...Nf6.} 6. c3 Qf6 7. Bg5 {An interesting attack would result
from throwing up b4, e.g.: 7 b4 Bb6 8 Bb2 Ne5 9 Nxe5 dxe5 10
Kh1 anything 11 f4 and considering the freedom of White's
pieces, we give his game the preference.} Qg6 8. cxd4 Nxd4
9. Nxd4 Qxg5 10. f4 Qg6 11. Kh1 Nh6 12. h3 {Mr. Morphy's
blindfold games are singularly free from error; but here he
makes a slip, which is very promptly and accurately taken
advantage of by Mr. Kipping.} Bxh3 13. gxh3 Qxe4+ 14. Qf3 {The
result would have been the same if either the knight or rook
had interposed; indeed the loss of the piece was unavoidable.}
Qxd4 15. Re1+ Kd7 16. Na3 Bxa3 17. Bb5+ {A most ingenious
attempt to recover the game, though it was unsuccessful.} c6
18. bxa3 Rhe8 {It will be seen that if Black had taken the
bishop, the loss of the queen must have followed on White's
playing 19 Qxb7+ 20 Qe7+ and Rac1+, etc.} 19. Rac1 d5 20. Qb3
Kc7 {Here, also if the bishop had been taken, White would
again have won easily with Qxb5+.} 21. Bd3 Re3 22. Rxe3 Qxe3
23. Rb1 Qxh3+ 24. Kg1 b6 25. Re1 Qg3+ 26. Kf1 Qxf4+ 27. Kg2
Qg5+ 28. Kf1 Ng4 29. Re2 Ne3+ 0-1
