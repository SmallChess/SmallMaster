{So far it's exactly like the third game of the match when I
continued 16 Ng3.} 16.Bg5 {The idea being either to get rid of
Black's important King's Bishop or to hamper its
development. The position is now getting very complicated.} h6
17.Bh4 Qb6 {This is much too passive a move and Black will
almost immediately get into trouble.} 18.Qd3 {The threat being
19 Bxf6, followed by e5. Black can't parry this by 18...Be6 on
account of 19 Bxf6 Bc4 20 Qxd4, hence the loosening of Black's
K-wing is practically forced.} g5 19.Bg3 Be6 20.Rad1 {!} Rfc8
21.Bb1 Nd7 22.e5 Nf8 23.Qf3 {Threatening exd6 followed by
Qf6.} d5 24.Qh5 Kg7 25.f4 {Threatening f5.} f5 {Like an
ancient Roman hero Tarrasch throws himself on his own sword!
Evidently he did not feel like offering some prolonged
resistance by 25...Ng6.} 26.exf6 Bxf6 27.fxg5 hxg5 28.Be5 d3+
