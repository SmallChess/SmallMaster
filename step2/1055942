1.d4 {Notes by J. Lowenthal} f5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Bb4
5.Qb3 c5 { A very similar position occurs in the Sicilian
opening, and then, as here, this move is important and
effective.} 6.d5 e5 7.e3 O-O 8.Bd3 d6 9.Ne2 h6 10.Bxf6 Qxf6
11.a3 Bxc3+ 12.Qxc3 Qg6 13.O-O Nd7 14.b4 b6 15.f3 h5 { A
measure of precaution, to prevent White from playing g4, and
having in view also the advance h4 if he should play Ng3.}
16.Bc2 Bb7 17.Ba4 Qf7 18.Bxd7 Qxd7 19.bxc5 {The exchange of
Pawns here showed want of judgment for after giving up his
Bishop, the c-pawn was, of course, rendered very weak by the
line of play adopted; indeed, it was fatal to his game.} bxc5
20.f4 e4 21.Rab1 Ba6 22.Rfc1 Qa4 {The prompt advantage which
Mr. Morphy takes of the slightest error of his opponent, is
the chief characteristic of his game, and it is well
illustrated on this occasion.} 23.Ng3 h4 24.Nf1 Rab8 25.Nd2
Rb6 { Very well played; for if as was the case, the Rooks be
exchanged, the b-pawn is soon thrown up and a free passage
secured for the c-pawn, and if the exchange be not made, Black
doubles his Rooks on the b-file, with a far superior game.}
26.Rxb6 axb6 27.Qb3 Qxb3 28.Nxb3 b5 {Excellently followed up,
the c-pawn can now march on unimpeded, and embarrass White
sorely.} 29.cxb5 Bxb5 30.Na5 Ra8 31.Nb7 Ra6 32.Rc3 { This is
an interesting position} Kf8 33.Nd8 Bd7 34.Rb3 Ke7 35.Rb8 c4 {
The skilful manner in which Mr. Morphy terminated the game
commands our praise and is deserving of close attention.}
36.Kf2 c3 37.Ke2 Rxa3 38.Nc6+ Bxc6 39.dxc6 c2 40.Kd2 Rc3 {
When Mr. Harrwitz played 38 Nc6+, he evidently overlooked that
his opponent, on his 40th move, could play as in the text.}
41.Kc1 Rxc6 42.Rb3 Kf6 43.Ra3 g5 44.g3 hxg3 45.hxg3 gxf4
46.gxf4 Kg6 47.Ra5 Rc5 48.Ra6 Rc3 49.Rxd6+ Kh5 50.Rd2 Kg4
