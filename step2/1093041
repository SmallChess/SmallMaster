1.e4 {Notes by Geza Maroczy} e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bb5 d6
5.d4 Bd7 6.O-O Be7 {The position is now the same as in the
sixth game of the recent Lasker-Capablanca match.} 7.Bxc6 {But
here Mr. Lasker played 7 Re1; the text move is the correct
continuation for White, as it forces Black to retake with the
bishop to avoid losing his king-pawn.} Bxc6 8.Qd3 {Black is
now compelled either to give up the center by exd4 or to
defend the king-pawn.} Nd7 {In the 14th game in the match
referred to above Mr. Capablanca played 8...exd4.} 9.Be3 {If 9
d5 then 9...Nc5 attacking the queen and making an escape for
the bishop.} exd4 10.Bxd4 O-O 11.Nd5 Bxd5 12.exd5 Bf6 13.Rfe1
Bxd4 14.Qxd4 Qf6 15.Rad1 a6 {Better than exchanging queens
which would have brought the white knight in at d4 threatening
to enter either at b5 or f5.} 16.Qxf6 Nxf6 17.c4 Rfe8 18.Rxe8+
Rxe8 19.Kf1 Kf8 20.b3 g6 21.Nd4 Ne4 22.Ne2 b5 {The game was
perfectly even and a draw was the legitimate result.} 1/2-1/2
