1. d4 {Notes by R. Teichmann} Nf6 2. c4 c5 {An original way of
meeting the Queen's Gambit, but certainly not a good one. The
player who in a close game can push his Queen's Pawn to d5 and
maintain it there has, as a rule, the better game.} 3. d5 d6
4. Nc3 g6 5. e4 Bg7 6. Bd3 {Certainly f4, with a view of
forcing e5 sooner or later, was the right course here.} O-O
7. Nge2 Nbd7 8. Nf4 Ne5 9. Be2 b6 10. h4 h5 11. f3 Rb8 12. Nh3
a6 13. a4 Re8 14. Nf2 e6 15. Bg5 exd5 16. Nxd5 Be6 17. Ne3 Qd7
18. Nh3 {All this seems somewhat inconsistent and without a
preconceived plan.} Nc6 19. Bf4 Bxh3 20. Rxh3 Nd4 21. Bd3 Rb7
22. Kf2 Ne6 23. Bg3 Bh6 24. Nd5 Nxd5 25. cxd5 Nf4 {So far
Black has done very well, and obtained the superior position,
which he could have improved with Nc7, preparing an advance of
the Queen's side Pawns. The text move is an oversight which
loses the exchange and a Pawn.} 26. Bxf4 Bxf4 27. Bxa6 Be5
28. Bxb7 Bd4+ 29. Kf1 Qxb7 30. Qb3 Ra8 31. Rb1 Qa6+ 32. Qb5
Qxa4 33. Qxa4 Rxa4 34. f4 Rb4 35. b3 c4 36. Ke2 Kf8 {Bc5 seems
to give him a much better chance, threatening ...cxb3 and
...Rxe4+.} 37. Kd2 Bf6 38. Re3 c3+ 39. Kc2 Bd4 40. Re2 Rb5
{Concluding the game with another blunder. after this the rook
or bishop is lost.} 41. b4 f5 42. Kd3 1-0
