1. e4 {Notes by Dr. Tarrasch} e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bc4 Be7 4. c3
Nf6 5. d3 O-O 6. Nbd2 Nc6 7. Bb3 {To prevent the exchange of
the king's bishop after Na5.} Be6 8. Bc2 d5 {In consequence of
the two bishop's moves on the part of White, Black gets now
the initiative, but does not know how to make use of it.}
9. Qe2 Bd6 {Much stronger was Nd7 and f5.} 10. Nf1 a6 {Black
shows clearly that he does not know what to do with his good
position; Steinitz on the other hand, true to his method,
tries to obtain one advantage after another. This game offers
a good example of his method of play.} 11. Ng5 Qd7 {Black
should not allow the exchange of the bishop, but should
withdraw it to d7. Perhaps he was afraid of the continuation
12 exd5 Nxd5 13 Nxh7 (...Kxh7 14 Qe4+ and Qxd5) but after
13...Re8 White would have been very much embarrased by the
threat of Nf4.} 12. Ne3 dxe4 {It is again evident that Black
has no definite plan.} 13. dxe4 Ne7 14. f3 Bc5 15. Nxe6 Qxe6
16. Bb3 Qc6 17. g4 Bxe3 {So that the knight should not
establish itself on f5.} 18. Bxe3 Ng6 19. O-O-O {White has now
with his bishops a far superior game.} Rad8 20. h4 Rxd1+
21. Rxd1 Re8 {Nxh4 would be wrong on account of giving
possesion of the open file to the queen and rook.} 22. h5 Nf8
23. h6 g6 24. g5 N6d7 25. Bd5 {The advance of the pawns has
prepared this move, and White now wins a pawn and with it the
game.} Qa4 26. Bxb7 Qxa2 27. Qxa6 Qb3 28. Bd5 {The bishop is
indefatigable.} Qb8 29. Qa2 Re7 30. Qa8 Qxa8 {After Qb5 might
follow 31 Bc6 Qe2 32 Bc5 Nxc5 33 Qxf8+, etc.} 31. Bxa8 Ne6
32. Bd5 Nf4 {This hastens the end.} 33. Bc6 Nf8 34. Bc5 1-0
