1.d4 {Notes by J. R. Capablanca} d5 2.Nf3 e6 3.c4 Nf6 4.Bg5
Nbd7 5.e3 Be7 6.Nc3 O-O 7.Rc1 Re8 8.Qc2 c6 9.Bd3 dxc4 10.Bxc4
Nd5 11.Bxe7 Rxe7 12.O-O Nf8 13.Rfd1 Bd7 {I do not consider the
system adopted by Dr. Lasker in this game to be any good.}
14.e4 Nb6 {...Nxc3 would have simplified matters somewhat, but
it would have left Black in avery awkward position. The text
move, by driving back the bishop, gains time for the defense.}
15.Bf1 Rc8 16.b4 {To prevent c5, either now or a later
stage. There is no Black bishop and White’s whole plan is
based on that fact. He will attempt, in due time, to place a
knight on d6.} Be8 17.Qb3 {White might have played a4 at once,
but wanted at first to prevent the Black Queen from coming out
via d6 an f4.} Rec7 18.a4 Ng6 19.a5 Nd7 20.e5 b6 21.Ne4 Rb8
22.Qc3 {Qa3 at once was best. The text move gives Black a
chance to gain time.} Nf4 23.Nd6 Nd5 {Had the White Queen been
at a3 Black could not have gained this very important tempo.}
24.Qa3 f6 25.Nxe8 {This Bishop had to be taken, since it
threatened to go to h5, pinning the Knight.} Qxe8 26.exf6 gxf6
{To retake with either Knight would have left the e Pawn
extremely weak.} 27.b5 {With this move White gets rid of his
Queen's side Pawns.} Rbc8 28.bxc6 Rxc6 29.Rxc6 Rxc6 30.axb6
axb6 31.Re1 {Bb5 was better.} Qc8 32.Nd2 {This was my sealed
move and unquestionably the only move to keep the initiative.}
Nf8 {...Rc3 would have been met by Qa1.} 33.Ne4 {The White
Knight stands now in a very commanding position. Black's game
is far more difficult than appears at first glance and I
believe that the only good system of defense would have to be
based on ...f5, after ...h6, driving back the White Knight.}
Qd8 34.h4 Rc7 {This might be said to be the losing move. Black
had to play ...h6 in order to be ready to continue with ...f5,
forcing the White Knight to withdraw.} 35.Qb3 {White's plan
consists in getting rid of Black's powerfully posted Knight at
d5, which is the key to Black's defense.} Rg7 36.g3 Ra7 37.Bc4
Ra5 38.Nc3 Nxc3 39.Qxc3 Kf7 40.Qe3 Qd6 41.Qe4 Ra4 {Neither one
of us had very much time left at this stage of the
game. Black's alternative was ...Ra7, which would have been
met by d5, leaving Black with what in my opinion is a lost
position.} 42.Qb7+ Kg6 {If 42...Qe7 43.Qc6 wins.} 43.Qc8 Qb4
44.Rc1 Qe7 {Black's game was now hopeless; for instance
44...Qa3 (best) 45.Bd3+! f5 (best) 46.Qe8+ Kh6 47.Re1 Ra8
48.Rxe6+ Nxe6 49.Qxe6+ Kg7 50.Qe5+, etc. In practically all
the other variations the check with the Bishop at d3 wins.}
45.Bd3+ Kh6 {..f5 would have prolonged the game a few moves
only. 46.Rc7 would always win.} 46.Rc7 Ra1+ 47.Kg2 Qd6
48.Qxf8+ 1-0
