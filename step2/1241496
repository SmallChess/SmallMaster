1.d4 {Notes by J. R. Capablanca} d5 2.Nf3 e6 3.c4 Nf6 4.Bg5
Be7 5.e3 Nbd7 6.Nc3 O-O 7.Rc1 c6 8.Qc2 c5 {this move is not to
be recommended.} 9.Rd1 {cxd5 would have been proper to
continue.} Qa5 10.cxd5 Nxd5 11.Bxe7 Nxe7 12.Bd3 Nf6 13.O-O
cxd4 14.Nxd4 {exd4 was the alternative. It would have left,
however, to a very difficult game where,in exchange for the
attack, White would remain with an isolated Queen’s Pawn;
leading at thi stage of the match by one point, I did not want
to take any risks.} Bd7 15.Ne4 Ned5 16.Nb3 Qd8 17.Nxf6+ Nxf6
18.Qc5 Qb6 {With this move Black neutralizes whatever little
advantage White might have had. The draw is now insight.}
