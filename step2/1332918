1. Nf3 { Notes by Janowski. } d5 2. d4 Nf6 3. c4 e6 4. Nc3 Be7
5. e3 O-O 6. Be2 b6 7. O-O c5 8. b3 Nc6 {Better 8...Nbd7.}
9. Bb2 Bb7 10. Rc1 Rc8 11. a3 dxc4 12. bxc4 cxd4 {Black's aim
is to weaken and then attack his opponent's centre pawns.}
13. exd4 Na5 14. Ne5 Nd7 {!} 15. Nxd7 Qxd7 16. Nb1 {To defend
the weak pawn on c4.} 16...Ba6 {? 16...Rfd8 followed by Be7-f6
would have given White more problems with the defence of his
pawns.} 17. Nd2 Bf6 {Again 17...Rfd8 was better.} 18. Ne4 {!}
Be7 {Capturing on c4 would be too risky.} 19. d5 Rfd8 {On
19...exd5, White wins with 20 Qd4 f6 21 Bg4.} 20. Qd4 f6 {If
20...Bf8, then 21 Nf6+! gxf6 22 Qxf6 is decisive.} 21. Bg4 Nb3
22. Qe3 {But not 22 Qc3? Nxc1 23 Bxe6+ Qxe6! 24 dxe6 Ne2+, and
unexpectedly it is Black who wins.} 22...Qa4 23. Bxe6+ Kh8
24. d6 Bxd6 {This merely plays into White's hands.} 25. Nxf6
{!} Bxc4 26. Qh6 {!} 1-0
