1. e4 {Notes by Lowenthal} e6 2. d4 c6 {Mr Bierwith probaly
opened his game thus irregularly (as other of Mr. Morphy's
opponents did when he was playing blindfold) in the hope of
puzzling his antagonist; but this end was far from being
attained.} 3. Bd3 d5 4. exd5 exd5 5. Nf3 Bg4 6. O-O Bd6 7. h3
Bh5 8. Be3 Nd7 9. Re1 Ne7 10. Nbd2 {White, at this early stage
of the game, has all his pieces well in play.} Bxf3 11. Nxf3
h6 {A proper measure of precaution, as both the knight and
bishop are both prevented from being placed at g5.} 12. Qd2
Qc7 13. c4 dxc4 14. Bxc4 f5 15. Ne5 O-O-O {The advantage to be
gained by taking the knight was more apparent than real; for
if he take with the bishop, then follows : 16 fxe5 Nxe5 17 Be6
Rd8 18 Qc3 Qd6 19 Bc5 and must win ; and if with the knight,
then 16 fxe5 Bxe5 17 Bc5 Rd8 (best) 18 Qe2 Bf6 (best)19 Qe6
Rd7 (best if 19...Rf8 20 Bxe7 Bxe7 21 Qg6+ Kd7 22 Bd6+ wins)
20 Rad1 Rd5 ( We see no better move; for if 20... Kd8 then 21
Bxe7+ and wins, and if 20...Rf8 then 21 Bd6 with an excellent
game, and lastly if 20...Rxd1 21 Rxd1 Rf8 22 Bxe7 and wins) 21
Bxd5 cxd5 22 Bxe7 Bxe7 23 Rc1 and wins.} 16. Be6 Bxe5 17. dxe5
Kb8 18. Qc3 {Very well played, not only maintaining the pawn
but enabling him to play Qa3.} Nb6 19. Qa3 Nbc8 20. Rac1 g5
