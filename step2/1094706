1.e4 {Notes by Carl Schlechter from "Deutsche Schachzeitung"
1908.} e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bb5 Bb4 5.O-O O-O 6.d3 d6
7.Ne2 Bg4 {The usual continuation, 7...Ne7, leads to
complicated and not easy to be handled middlegame positions
for both players.} 8.Be3 Nh5 {? Weak, because here the knight
is not useful, and ...f7-f5, which probably was intended, is
not feasible. Best is 8...Ne7.} 9.Bxc6 bxc6 10.Ne1 {! White
could win a pawn by 10.c3 Ba5 11.Qa4, but after 11....Bb6
12.Bxb6 (12.Qxc6?! Rb8 13.b3 Bd7 14.Qc4 Bxe3 15.fxe3 Bb5)
12...axb6 13.Qxc6 Bd7 (also good is 13...Bxf3 and 14...Qf6)
14.Qc4 Be6, White must play again 15.Qc6 (15.Qb4? c5 16.Qb5
Ra5 17.Qc6 Qb8 etc., or 15.Qb5? Ra5 16.Qc6 Bd7 17.Qc4 Bb5
etc.), with a draw by repetition.} d5 {Black should capture
both knights and then bring the knight back into play with
...Nf6. In this case he would have good chances.} 11.f3 Be6
12.g4 Nf6 13.Ng3 {Premature is 13.Ng2? because of 13...dxe4
14.dxe4 Bc4!.} d4 {? Better is 13...Bd6.} 14.Bd2 Be7 15.Ng2
Rb8 16.b3 c5 17.Nf5 Bxf5 18.gxf5 Rb6 19.Rf2 Qd7 20.Qe2 Rfb8
21.f4 exf4 22.Bxf4 c4 {An attempt for counterplay in a
position that is already strategically lost.} 23.bxc4 {If
23.dxc4 Bc5 24.Qd3 Ng4 25.Re2 f6, followed by ...Ne5.} Rb1+
24.Rxb1 Rxb1+ 25.Rf1 Rb2 26.e5 Ne8 27.Bg3 Qa4 28.f6 {!} Bf8
{If 28....Rxc2 29.Qg4 Bf8 30.e6 and White wins. The best
defense is 28...gxf6 29.exf6 Bf8.} 29.Qg4 g6 {If 29...Qxc2
30.Bf2.} 30.e6 Rxc2 31.Ne1 {!} Rxa2 32.exf7+ Kxf7 33.Nf3 Nxf6
34.Ng5+ Kg7 35.Rxf6 {!} Kxf6 36.Qf4+ Ke7 37.Qf7+ Kd8 38.Ne6+
1-0
