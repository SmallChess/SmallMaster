1.e4 {Notes by Emanuel Lasker} e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 exd4 4.Nxd4
Bc5 5.Be3 Bb6 6.Nc3 d6 7.Nd5 {What with White having to
forfeit a tempo so as to get rid of the Bishop. Black has
quickly managed to equalise.} Nf6 8.Nxb6 axb6 9.Nxc6 {This
exchange is quite unnecessary and merely strengthens Black's
centre, giving him the initiative.} bxc6 10.Bd3 Qe7 11.O-O Qe5
12.Qc1 O-O 13.Re1 Re8 14.f3 Nd7 15.c3 Nf8 16.Qd2 Qh5 17.Bf4 f6
{ White must not be allowed to open up diagonals for his
Bishops by e5.} 18.a3 Be6 19.Bg3 Nd7 20.Re3 Qf7 21.Rae1 Bc4
22.Bc2 Ra5 23.Qc1 Kh8 24.Qd1 Re7 25.Qd2 Bb3 26.Bxb3 {This
exchange is forced for if he retreated Bb1 Black would get an
overwhelming position by advancing his c-pawn and later
playing his Knight to d3 via c5.} Qxb3 27.Rc1 Qf7 28.Rd1
{Better would be c4.} Kg8 29.Qc2 Ra8 30.Ree1 b5 31.Ra1 Nc5
{Parrying the counter-thrust of the a-pawn just in time.}
32.Bf2 Nb3 33.Rad1 Ree8 34.Be3 Qc4 35.Qe2 Re7 36.Qc2 {If he
swapped Queens, the b-pawn would prove untenable in the long
run.} Rae8 37.Bf2 Re6 {Black is about to move his King over to
the Queen-Wing and there is little that White can do about
it.} 38.Qb1 h5 {To forestall an attack on the pawn by e5, once
the Black King has moved.} 39.h3 Kf7 40.g4 {White must weaken
his own position in the attempt to disturb Black's plan by an
attack.} hxg4 41.hxg4 d5 42.exd5 Rxe1+ 43.Bxe1 {Rxe1 is ruled
out by ...Nd2, etc.} Qe2 44.dxc6 Qxf3 45.Rd7+ Kg8 46.Qd1 Re2
47.Qd5+ Qxd5 48.Rxd5 Rxe1+ 49.Kf2 Re6 50.Rxb5 Nd2 51.a4 Ne4+
