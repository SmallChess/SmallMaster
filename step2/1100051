5. a4 Bf5 6. e3 Na6 {The idea to get the Knight to b4. A very
remarkable novelty of Lasker's.} 7. Bxc4 Nb4 8. O-O e6 9. Qe2

Rad8 15. f3 c5 16. d5 exd5 17. exd5 {Now White has an isolated
pawn and his K position is less secure than the opponent's;
moreover his pieces on the open e-file are placed rather
awkwardly. It might have been safer for him first to exchange
two pieces on d5.} a6 18. Qf2 Qc7 19. Rac1 Rfe8 20. g3 Bd6
21. Bf1 {? Evidently so as to parry the threat ...Bxg3
followed by ...Rxe3 but this could have been more efficiently
done by 21 Kg2; moreover it is no proper threat at all. As a
matter of fact, White could safely play 21 Na2 (so as to get
rid of the awkward Black Knight) and then ...Bxg3 would be a
bad blunder on account of 22 hxg3 Rxe3 whereafter 23 d6! would
make nonsense of Black's entire combination. After the text
move, though, White's game is hardly tenable.} b6 22. a5
