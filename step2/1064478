1.d4 {Notes by R. Teichmann} d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Be7
5.Nf3 O-O 6.e3 b6 7.Rc1 Bb7 8.cxd5 exd5 9.Bd3 c5 10.O-O Nbd7
11.dxc5 Nxc5 {Instead of this move, which leaves the d-pawn
isolated, I prefer ...bxc5. The two pawns can in this
variation be sufficiently supported, and will form the basis
of a counter-attack on the Queen's side.} 12.Bb1 Rc8 13.Bf5
Ne6 14.Bh4 Kh8 {This is certainly a weakening move, but the
position is very delicate and Black is at a loss what to do.}
15.Ne5 Qe8 16.Qf3 { Threatening Qh3 followed by Nxf7.} Ng8
17.Bg3 Nh6 18.Bb1 f6 19.Nd3 Qd7 20.Qd1 Rfd8 21.Nf4 Nxf4 {This
exchange is ill-judged and causes serious trouble. It would
have been better to retire the knight to f8, where it would
support h7, and then to try a counter-attack on the Queen's
side, where his Rooks are in commanding positions.} 22.Bxf4 g5
{And this premature advance compromises his King's side
irretrievably. An attack on the King's side is, on the face of
it, without prospect.} 23.Bg3 Bf8 24.Qd3 f5 {Creating another
weakness. One of these two weak Pawns (d5 and f5) must fall in
a few moves.} 25.Ne2 Bg7 26.Nd4 Rf8 27.Rxc8 Qxc8 28.Qd2 {Very
subtle. The Queen is excellently posted here, and the Rook can
now take possession of the important c-file.} Rf7 29.Rc1 Qe8
30.h4 gxh4 31.Bxh4 Bc8 32.Bg3 Ng4 33.Nb5 {This powerful move
leaves Black defenseless. The whole game was very well played
by Mr. Lasker, and it is a good specimen of this variation of
the Queen's Gambit, in which White maintains an advantage
throughout by combining a direct attack on the King with a
continuous pressure on the weak isolated d-pawn.} Rf8 34.Nd6
Qe6 35.Rxc8 Rxc8 36.Bxf5 { and Black resigned.} 1-0
