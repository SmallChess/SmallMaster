1. e4 { Notes by Raymond Keene. } e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e5
b6 5. a3 Bf8 {Black has chosen an anti-intuitive system in
which he not only postpones the development of his pieces, but
also retreats to the back rank the only piece he has so far
developed. This is the kind of defence calculated to enrage
the classically minded Kasparov. The virtues of Black's system
are its solidity and the potential mobility of his queenside
pawn mass. } 6. Nf3 Ne7 7. h4 h6 8. h5 {Played to cramp
Black's kingside, but Black, following the Nimzowitsch
example, has not yet committed himself to castling on either
flank. } 8...a5 9. Bb5+ c6 10. Ba4 {An artificial decision. In
the further course of play this bishop becomes a target for
Black's advancing pawns thus involving White in a serious loss
of time and space. It seems more sensible to play 10 Bd3 with
the plan of Ne2 and c3. After 10 Bd3 White can meet 10...c5
with 11 Nb5 Nec6 12 dxc5 bxc5 13 c4, exploiting his lead in
development. Black's best after 10 Bd3 is doubtless 10...Ba6
when White could try 11 Bf4 Bxd3 12 cxd3 sacrificing pawn
structure for dynamic chances in the c-file. } 10...Nd7
11. Ne2 b5 12. Bb3 c5 13. c3 Nc6 14. O-O Qc7 {In spite of his
lack of development, Black's position is rich in resources. He
clearly, for example, possesses the initiative on the queen's
flank. Kasparov's next move is a further waste of time. His
plan should be to attack Black's position by utilising the
White f-pawn as a battering ram. To that end White's most
promising course is 15 Nh2 followed immediately by f4 and f5
when White's knights, after due preparation with Be3, can then
gallop directly to aggressive squares such as f4 and g4. }
15. Re1 c4 16. Bc2 Nb6 17. Bf4 Be7 18. Bg3 Rb8 19. Nh2 {At
last, but the force of the f4-advance has been weakened by
White's displacement of his queen's rook. } 19...Qd8 {A
mysterious defensive move. The only justification I can see
for it is that Black wishes to remove his queen from the
potential long term range of White's dark-squared bishop.}
20. Ng4 b4 21. axb4 axb4 22. cxb4 {White could still eliminate
all risk by playing 22 b3 at once when 22...bxc3 23 Nxc3 Bb4
can be met by 24 Re3. } 22...Nxb4 23. Bb1 Bd7 {The critical
moment. White now mistimes his effort to eliminate his one
queenside weakness, the b-pawn. By playing instead 24 Qd2 he
would maintain the balance of the position. In particular,
Black could not then complete his mobilisation with 24...O-O
on account of possible sacrifices against the h6-pawn
introduced with 25 Bf4. Note, however, that White cannot
sacrifice at once with 25 Nxh6+ gxh6 26 Qxh6 on account of
26...Nd3. } 24. b3 Ra8 25. Rxa8 Qxa8 26. bxc4 Nxc4 {Black's
knights have seized dominating posts. } 27. Nc1 Ba4 {White's
pieces are in a terrible tangle and it suddenly transpires
that he cannot defend his pawn on d4. } 28. Qe2 Qa7 29. Ne3
Qxd4 30. Nxc4 dxc4 31. Qf1 {A counsel of despair. } 31...O-O
{At long last Black completes his mobilisation. This is one of
the later instances of castling in a grandmaster game and with
Black's king now in safety, Kasparov decided to resign. White
is only a pawn down, but the advance of Black's passed c-pawn
will inevitably cost White a piece.} 0-1
