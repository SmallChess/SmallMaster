1.e4 {Notes by J. Lowenthal} c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 e6
5.Be3 {The move we recommend here is 5 Nb5, eg.: 5...a6 (or A
and B) 6 Nd6+ Bxd6 7 Qxd6 and as we have proved in three games
played against Anderssen, Morphy, and Staunton, White's game
is to be preferred - (A) 5...d6 6 Bf4 e5 7 Be3 and Black's
d-pawn being unsupported, is weak, and his game is inferior. -
(B) 5...Nf6 6 Nc3 Bb4 7 Nd6+} Nf6 6.Bd3 e5 {Never a good move
when the d-pawn is left in the rear without support, which as
the game advances, becomes the object of attack, and as a
general rule, falls.} 7.Nxc6 bxc6 8.O-O d6 9.f4 exf4 10.Bxf4

{A very instructive position as will be found from its study.}
26.Rh6 Rhb8 27.Bxe6 Rb1 28.Rg1 fxe6 29.Rxh7+ Kd6 30.Rxa7 {The
combination has been carried out with the accuracy that would
have done credit to a first-rate with the board and men before
him, and which is therefore marvelous when we reflect that it
was conducted blindfold and while the player was engaged
simultaneously with seven other games. there is now the clear
gain of a pawn.} Rxg1+ 31.Kxg1 Rb1+ 32.Kf2 Rb2 33.h4 Rxc2+
