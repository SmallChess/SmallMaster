1. e4 {Notes by Lowenthal} e5 2. f4 Bc5 3. Nf3 d6 4. c3 Bg4
5. Bc4 Nf6 6. fxe5 Bxf3 {Black must take the knight, for if
...dxe5, White replies Bxf7+, etc.} 7. Qxf3 dxe5 8. d3 Nc6
9. Bg5 a6 10. Nd2 Be7 11. O-O-O Qd7 12. Nf1 {This is a good
move, for when the knight comes to e3, it can be played either
to d5 or f5 with great advantage.} O-O-O 13. Ne3 {To have
taken on f7 would have been dangerous.} h6 14. Bh4 g5 15. Bg3
Rdf8 16. Nd5 Ne8 {He could not exchange knight without losing
his e-pawn.} 17. d4 {Remarkably well played, securing a free
file for the queen's rook and opening a diagonal for his
queen's bishop to attack the king's position.} exd4 18. cxd4
{Bxc7 would also have been a powerful reply as a check would
have been threatened to both king and queen.} Bd8 19. Rhf1 Nd6
20. Bb3 Nb5 21. Qe3 f5 {this was a very unadvisable step, and
one by which his game is terribly compromised.} 22. exf5 Rxf5
23. Nb6+ {Taking due advantage of the imprudent advance of the
f-pawn.} cxb6 24. Be6 {If white had taken rook instead, Black
would have saved his Queen with ...Re8. It is evident that if,
on rook takes rook, the queen had reataken, mate would have
followed in two moves.} Rd5 25. Rf7 Ne7 26. Kb1 {All this is
astonishingly well played, when we consider that it is played
blindfold, and with so many games at hand at the same time.}
Re8 27. Rc1+ Nc7 28. Bxd7+ Rxd7 29. d5 Nc6 30. dxc6 Rxe3
