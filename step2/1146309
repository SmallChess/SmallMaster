1. e4 {Notes by Emanuel Lasker} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 d6 4. d4
Bd7 5. Nc3 exd4 6. Nxd4 g6 {A new attempt to shorten the usual
manoeuvre Bishop-e7-f8, g6, Bg7 by the seemingly wasted couple
of moves but this doesn't turn out too well since White now
adopts an entirely different set-up enabling him to exploit
the weakness of Black's f6 and h6 rather more decisively than
in the normal variation.} 7. Be3 Bg7 8. Qd2 Nf6 {If 8...Nge7
the White pawn would march to h4 and h5 forthwith.} 9. f3 O-O
10. O-O-O a6 11. Be2 b5 12. h4 Ne5 13. Bh6 Nc4 {Black would
seem to obtain a lively and promising attack by pawn attacks
of the Kt b5 c5 and c4 as well as at b4 and c3. But that is
not so since the Pawns will fall by the wayside.} 14. Bxc4
bxc4 15. h5 c6 {If 15...Nxh5 then 16 Bxg7 Kxg7 17 g4 Nf6 18
Qh6+ Kg8 19 Nd5; or even stronger perhaps 19 g5 Nh5 20 Nd5,
etc.} 16. Bxg7 Kxg7 17. hxg6 fxg6 18. Nde2 Rf7 19. Qxd6 Qb6
20. Qd4 c5 21. Nd5 Qb7 22. Qc3 Raf8 23. Nxf6 Rxf6 24. Rd6 1-0
