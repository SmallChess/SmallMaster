1. e4 {Notes by J. Lowenthal} e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Bc4 {Should
White play Nc3, Black would answer with ...Bb4. The game is
then usually continued as follows : 3 Nc3 Bb4 4 Nxe5 Bxc3 5
dxc3 d6 6 Nf3 Nxe4 7 Bd3 Nf6 (best if ...d5 7 c4 with the
better game) 8 O-O O-O and neither party can be said to have
the slightest advantage.} Nxe4 {This move leads to an even
game, as does also ...d5, which Lichtenhein played against
morphy; but there is also ...Nxc3 from which spring several
interesting positions. Black's game is cramped thereby, and
must remain so for a considerable time; but, in opposition to
several very able authorities, we are of the opinion that if
properly conducted the defence through advantage of the pawn
will most certainly win. In proof of this we submit the
following variation : 4...Nxc3 5 dxc3 f6 6 Nh4 (6 O-O Qe7 7
Na4 g6 followed by ...c6 with a good game) Qe7 7 Qh5+ Kd8 8
Ng6 Qe8 9 Bd3 Be7 winning a piece.} 4. Nc3 Nf6 5. Nxe5 d5
6. Bb3 Be7 7. d4 c6 8. O-O Nbd7 9. f4 {Playing his favorite
move early in the gamr.} Nb6 10. Qf3 h5 11. f5 {The queen's
bishop of the second player is now completely hemmed in and
time must be lost in extricating it.} Qc7 12. Bf4 Bd6 13. Rae1
Kf8 14. Qg3 h4 {If Black had taken pawn with bishop, White
would have checked with the kight on g6 and gained an evident
advantage.} 15. Ng6+ {A most able move, frustating at once all
of the combinations of his opponent.} Kg8 16. Bxd6 hxg3
17. Bxc7 fxg6 18. fxg6 gxh2+ 19. Kh1 Bg4 20. Re7 Nbd7 21. Be5
Kf8 22. Rf7+ Kg8 23. Nxd5 {One of those brilliant combinations
in which Mr. Morphy has made himself so famous, and which
occur with equal frequecy in his blindfold games as in those
that he has conducted with board and men before him.} cxd5
24. Bxd5 Nb6 25. Bb3 1-0
