28.Nb4 Kg7 29.Nd5 Bd4 30.a4 {Missing the direct path to
victory. After: 30.e3! Bc5 31.Kf3!, the win is as clear as a
sunny sky. White's King is making a beeline to the b5-square,
where the b6-pawn is captured and the a-pawn is escorted to
coronation. -- Seirawan} Bc5 31.h3 { This is a real groaner. I
think the text throws away most of the winning chances that
were left. I was still wildly optimistic about White's chances
after 31.Kf3! One point is to trick the computer into playing
an innocuous move like: 31...Kg6? After which White plays:
32.e3!, and he is back in business as his King goes to the
b5-square. -- Seirawan} f6 32.f3 Kg6 33.e4 h5 34.g4 hxg4
