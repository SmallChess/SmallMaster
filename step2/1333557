1.d4 {Notes by Eric Schiller.} d5 2.c4 dxc4 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.e3 g6
{ This is not the most common continuation. Usually Black
plays an early ...e6, locking in the light-squared
bishop. This can lead to great difficulties later on, and
while the system is suitable for masters, it is not easy to
play for beginners. On the other hand, this fianchetto play is
easy to play, even if not as objectively sound.} 5.Bxc4 Bg7
6.O-O O-O 7.Nc3 Nfd7 { Smyslov's system. The idea is to bring
the knight to b6, driving back the enemy bishop, and then
striking at the center with ...c5 or ...e5.} 8.Qe2 { 8.e4 Nb6
9.Be2 Bg4 10.Be3 Nc6 was played in Evans - Smyslov, Helsinki
Olympiad 1952, which was a game I had studied in preparation
for this contest. Black has a lot of pressure on the
center. Play continued 11.d5 Bxf3 12.Bxf3 Ne5 13.Be2 Nec4 with
pressure on the long diagonal. After 14.Bc1 c6! Black had a
strong game. } Nb6 9.Bb3 Nc6 {!? An attempt to improve on
Golombek - Smyslov, Budapest 1952, which saw 9...a5.} 10.Rd1
Bg4 11.h3 Bxf3 12.Qxf3 Qe8 {This move has the goal of blasting
open the center. After the king moves to the h-file Black can
advance both e- and f-pawns. 12...e5 13.dxe5 } 13.Nb5 {?!
Gligoric improved against me a week or two later with
13. Ne4!, with the threat of Nc5. Serves me right for getting
the game published in the New York Times!} Rc8 14.Bd2 a6
15.Na3 Kh8 16.Rac1 e5 {!} 17.d5 e4 18.Qf4 { Now it is clear
that the Nc6 is headed for e5, with the possibility of jumping
into f3. If only the g-file were open and a rook stood on
g8...} g5 {!} 19.Qxg5 Ne5 20.Bc3 {The pin looks strong - but
checks have been known to break pins! 20.g3 Nf3+ } Nf3+ {!!
20...Nd3 21.Qxg7# } 21.gxf3 Bxc3 22.Kh1 { 22.bxc3 Rg8 22.Rxc3
Rg8 } Rg8 23.Qf4 Qd7 24.Qh4 { 24.Rxc3 Qxh3+ 25.Qh2 Qxf3+
26.Qg2 Qxg2# } Qf5 {! Black continues to make threats while
improving the position of his queen, before capturing the pawn
at b2.} 25.f4 Bxb2 26.Rg1 Bxc1 27.Rxc1 Qg6 {White's position
is hopeless.} 28.Qg4 Qxg4 29.hxg4 Rxg4 {White could have
resigned here.} 30.Rg1 Rxg1+ 31.Kxg1 Rd8 32.d6 Rxd6 33.Bxf7
Rd3 34.Nc2 c5 35.Be6 Rc3 36.Ne1 Rc1 37.Kf1 Nc4 38.Ke2 b5

resigned.} 0-1
