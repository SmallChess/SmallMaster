1.e4 {Notes by R. Teichmann} e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 exd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6
5.Nxc6 bxc6 6.e5 {Mieses has the credit of having revived this
good variation of the Scotch game by adopting it several times
in this tournament with success.} Nd5 {Doubtless best, and
preferable to Ng8 or Qe7 as played by myself against Mieses.}
7.Bd3 Bc5 8.Qg4 g6 9.Bg5 Be7 10.Bh6 d6 11.Qg3 Be6 12.Nc3 Bh4
13.Qf3 Bg5 14.Bxg5 Qxg5 15.exd6 cxd6 16.Be4 {White has played
this opening in a very spirited manner, and with this move
gets a decisive advantage in position.} O-O 17.Bxd5 cxd5
18.O-O Rab8 19.b3 Rb4 20.g3 Rc8 21.Rfe1 Qd2 22.Re3 d4 23.Ne4
Qxc2 24.Re2 Qc7 25.Qf4 d3 26.Qh6 {A pretty combination.} f5
{This move ought to lose. He had a valid defence in Qe7 if
then 27 Ng5 Qf6 with the better game. He could also have
sacrificed the exchange by Rxe4, which would have enabled him
to draw the game, the advanced passed pawn then becoming very
strong.} 27.Nf6+ Kf7 28.Nh5 {Extremely fine, and the key move
to the whole combination. Black must take the knight for if
dxe2 then 29 Qg7+ Ke8 30 Nf6+ Kd8 31 Qf8 mate.} gxh5 29.Qxh7+
{With this, however, he throws away a well-deserved
victory. The obvious move Rxe6 would have forced the game in a
few moves, eg. 29 Rxe6 Qc3 (best) 30 Rd1 (! Not 30 Re1 on
account of 30...Re4) Re4 (there is nothing else) 31 Rxe4 fxe4
32 Qxh7+ K moves 33 Qxe4 and wins easily.} Kf8 30.Qh8+ Kf7
31.Qxh5+ Ke7 32.Qh7+ Kd8 33.Qh8+ Kd7 34.Qg7+ Kc6 35.Qxc7+ {A
fatal mistake. He could still have drawn with Qc3+ because
Black must play his king back to d7 and cannot avoid the
perpetual check.} Rxc7 36.Rxe6 Kd5 37.Ree1 Re4 38.Rxe4 fxe4
39.Kf1 Ke5 40.h4 d5 41.Rd1 d4 42.h5 Rh7 43.f3 Rxh5 44.Kg2 e3
{If 45 Rxd3 then of course ...Rh1 (!) 36 Kxh1 e2 winning.}
45.g4 e2 46.Re1 Rh8 47.Kf2 Kf4 48.Rg1 Rh2+ 0-1
