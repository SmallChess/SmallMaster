1. e4 {Notes by L. Gunsberg} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 {If a
census were taken of the games played with the d6 defence as
against any other defence to the Ruy Lopez, it would be found
that this move has up to the present produced the worst
proportionate results.} 4. Ba4 d6 5. O-O Ne7 6. c3 Bd7 7. d4
Ng6 8. Re1 Be7 9. Nbd2 O-O 10. Nf1 Qe8 {Somehow or other we do
not believe in the manouvre of bringing the White Queen’s
Knight over on to the King’s side; we think too much time is
lost thereby, and it is advisable for Black to adopt an
aggressive policy before White has time to fully develop his
Pieces. Suppose Black played exd4 instead of Qe8, and if 11
cxd4 , then b5 12 Bc2 Nb4 13 Bb3 c5 14 d5 c4 15 Bc2 Nxc2 16
Qxc2 f5. The point is to do something while the Knight is on
f1, and before it can get g3.} 11. Bc2 Kh8 12. Ng3 Bg4 {We do
not see what good can come from this move; anyway it would
have been stronger if exd4 had preceded it.} 13. d5 Nb8 14. h3
Bc8 {The fact that the Bishop ought not to have gone to g4 at
all must now be clear.Bxf3 would not have been an improvement,
as that would bring White’s Queen into play.} 15. Nf5 Bd8
16. g4 Ne7 17. Ng3 Ng8 {Black has now completed his strategic
movement towards the rear. If this is good strategy, then the
modern theory of development must be all wrong. One fact,
however, must be borne in mind. Black, having all his Pieces
concentrated on his base, is certainly less assailable, and
should White rashly advance against that formation, Black
might probably be able to break up the White line with
advantage to himself.} 18. Kg2 {Considering that Black’s only
hope lies in an advance of the King’s Bishop’s Pawn, we should
have preferred to play Kh2, so as to be able to occupy the
King’s Knight’s file with the Rook, which would effectually
prevent f5 at any future time. And, after developing his
Rooks, White could take his own time about cautiously turning
on the pressure.} Nd7 19. Be3 Nb6 20. b3 Bd7 21. c4 Nc8 {There
seems little prospect of Black being able to harass White by a
flank attack on the Queen’s side. Yet it is the only way at
present that promises some relief.} 22. Qd2 Nce7 23. c5 g6
24. Qc3 f5 {It was pointed out by Mr. Steinitz that he would
have done much better if he had played h6 first. In this we
perfectly agree with him, as it would have given the King some
elbow room, and would, therefore, have made the impending
sacrifice less profitable, which by-theby must have stared
Black in the face in rather an obvious manner.} 25. Nxe5 dxe5
26. Qxe5+ Nf6 27. Bd4 {White’s play is extremely
interesting. If he had simply contented himself with 27 g5,
Black might have replied in several ways: i.e. Nxd5 28 Bd4 Nb4
29 Bb1 Kg8 30 gxf6 Bxf6 31 Qxd8 Raxd8, etc. Though these moves
may be varied, we still think this line would have been
profitable for Black.} fxg4 {Kg8 would not have released the
Knight, as White would, nevertheless, have played g5, and the
Knight could not move. f4 also looks an enticing move, but
then White would have replied with 28. g5, and Black could not
take the Knight.} 28. hxg4 Bxg4 { This was a deceptive
move. It seemed no doubt advantageous to get rid of this
Knight’s Pawn, but it did not result favourably.} 29. Qg5 Qd7
30. Bxf6+ Kg8 31. Bd1 Bh3+ 32. Kg1 Nxd5 {Black played the
following moves with desperate ingenuity. The move of Rxf6
does not promise much, nor is h6 any better, except that it
would allow Black to play Kh7 on the following move, which
would give him more liberty of action.} 33. Bxd8 Nf4 34. Bf6
Qd2 35. Re2 {Though this is the only move on the board, yet it
answers all practical purposes of defence.} Nxe2+ 36. Bxe2 Qd7
37. Rd1 Qf7 {Black having failed in his counter-attack, there
is Iitth left for him to do. If he had played Qe8 or Qc6 it
would not have made much difference in the position.} 38. Bc4
Be6 39. e5 Bxc4 40. Nf5 {A neat finish to a brilliantly played
game.} 1-0
