1. e4 {Notes by J. R. Capablanca.} c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4
4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Bc4 d6 7. Nxc6 bxc6 8. e5 Ng4 {Of
course if 8...dxe5 9.Bxf7+.} 9. e6 {The advance of this pawnso
early in the game is at least very risky. Black's game is
perfectly safe, while White hto struggle to protect this
advanced pawn.} f5 10. O-O Bg7 11. Bf4 Qb6 {If 11...d5 12.Nxd5
cxd5 13.Qxd5 winning.} 12. Bb3 Ba6 13. Na4 Qd4 14. Qxd4 Bxd4
15. c4 O-O $1 16. Rad1 Bf6 {16...c5 was the alternative ; in
which case White would probably play 17.Nc3 Bxc3 18.bxc3 Kg7
19.Rfe1, and White's game seems good.} $1 17. Rfe1 $6 g5
18. Bxd6 {Played with very fine judgement. The pawn at e6
which was weak becomes very strong now.} $1 18... exd6
19. Rxd6 Be5 20. c5 {Fine. If 20...Bxd6 21.cxd6 and the two
white pawns would become irresistable. This is one of the
finest games of the match. Black has to play with great
caution to avoid White's many threats.} Rfe8 21. g3 {If 21.h3
Bh2+ 22.Kh1 Bxd6 23.cxd6 Nxf2+ 24.Kh2 Ne4, and if 21.f3 Bxh2+
22.Kh1 Bg3, or perhaps 22.Bxd6 23.cxd6 Nf2+ 24.Kh2 Nd3.} $1
Bf6 22. Rxc6 Bb7 {Black might have played here 22...Bb5 23.Rd6
Rac8, with what appears to be a very good game. If in answer
to 22...Bb5 23.Rc7 then 23...Re7, or if 23.e7+ in answer to
22...Bb5 then 23...Kg7 24.Rc7 Ne5 25.Re3 f4 26.Re4 Nf3+ 27.Kg2
Nd2 and Black's game looks very good.} 23. Rc7 Be4 24. Nc3
Bxc3 25. bxc3 Ne5 26. Rd1 Nf3+ 27. Kf1 Nxh2+ 28. Ke1 Nf3+
29. Ke2 Ne5 30. Rdd7 30... f4 31. Rg7+ Kh8 32. Rxg5 Bd3+
33. Kd1 fxg3 $1 34. fxg3 Ng6 {All this play is very
fine. Unfortunately for Black, he has no pawns left by the
time the attack is over.} 35. Rd5 Be4 36. Rd6 Bf5 37. Bd5 Rab8
38. c6 Nf8 39. Rb7 Rbc8 40. e7 Ng6 41. Bf7 Rxe7 42. Bxg6 Bg4+
