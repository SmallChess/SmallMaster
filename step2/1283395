1.d4 {Notes by James Mason} d5 2.e3 Nf6 3.Bd3 {On general
grounds, the King’s Knight should be played in preference to
the Bishop in this kind of game. Usually the Bishop has
several courses open to him during the earlier stages ; while,
as a rule, the Knight has but one good post at the outset,
viz. f6. The inference seems obvious.} Nc6 4.c3 e5 {Taking the
initiative directly. But White appears content with assuming a
more or less strictly defensive attitude ; which he very ably
maintains until driven to retaliatory measures by pressure of
events.} 5.dxe5 Nxe5 6.Be2 Bd6 7.Nf3 O-O 8.O-O Qe7 9.Nbd2 Rd8
10.Re1 Ne4 11.Nxe5 Qxe5 12.Nf1 {A surer protection than Nf3 in
this position.} Qg5 13.f4 Qh4 14.g3 Qe7 { Little could he
hoped for from Qh3, so she retires, satisfied for the moment
with having induced the probably weakening advance of the
Pawns.} 15.Bf3 Bc5 16.Qe2 f5 17.Bd2 Be6 18.Rad1 g5 {Clearly
enough Black plays to win; and from that policy some risk is
inseparable. It is found in the shape of serious danger to his
own King later on.} 19.Kh1 {!} gxf4 20.Bxe4 fxe4 21.exf4 {If
21 gxf4, then Qh4, etc. Profit from the open file would be all
on the other side.} Qg7 22.Ne3 Bxe3 23.Qxe3 Bg4 24.Rc1 Bf3+
25.Kg1 Qg4 26.Qf2 h5 {Part of the general plan indicated at
the i8th move. White does not want any closer acquaintance
with this Pawn for the present.} 27.h4 c5 {!} 28.Kh2 d4
29.cxd4 cxd4 30.Bb4 {The contest increases in difficulty. The
united passed Pawns are truly formidable. Yet White is not
dismayed.} e3 31.Qc2 Rd7 32.Qd3 Re8 33.Rc5 Be4 34.Qb5 {!} a6
{Best, no doubt. Any exchange of Queens now would leave the
passed Pawns good winning chances.} 35.Rg5+ Kh8 36.Qb6 {This
is a lost move with the Queen at a very critical period, and
it helps to lose the game. Qc5 at once was better.} Qe6
37.Rxh5+ Bh7 38.Qc5 b6 39.Qc1 a5 40.Re5 Qf7 41.Rxe8+ Qxe8
42.Ba3 Rg7 43.Bd6 {A curious error, losing straight away, for
the reply wins the Bishop of course. 43 b3, with soon Bb2,
etc., might have at least drawn.} Qg6 44.Qc8+ Bg8 45.g4 Qxd6
46.Kg3 Rf7 0-1
