5.O-O O-O 6.d3 d6 7.Bg5 Bxc3 8.bxc3 Ne7 {This is the usual
move introduced by Pillsbury, the alternative 8...Qe7 is not
very attractive.} 9.Bc4 {The usual Bxf6 is better, but
Janowski had a predilection for preserving his 2 Bishops.} Ng6
10.Nh4 {?} Nf4 {! This very strong move was first made by
Pillsbury.} 11.Bxf4 exf4 12.Nf3 {Loss of time; 12 g3 followed
by Ng2 was preferable.} Bg4 13.h3 Bh5 14.Rb1 b6 15.Qd2
{Unnecessary, but Janowski evidently hoped for attacking
chances on the open g-file.} Bxf3 16.gxf3 Nh5 17.Kh2 Qf6
18.Rg1 Rae8 19.d4 Kh8 20.Rb5 Qh6 21.Rbg5 f6 22.R5g4 g6 23.Bd3
{So as to stop ...f5.} Re7 24.c4 {A careless move: White might
have tried something more passive such as Qc1 or Rg2, but he
was under great time pressure.} Ng7 {!} 25.c3 {? d5!} Ne6
26.Bf1 f5 {!} 27.R4g2 Rf6 {!} 28.Bd3 g5 {!} 29.Rh1 {Only now
White sees the terrible threat of the Queen sacrifice, but
there is no defence anyway.} g4 30.Be2 Ng5 31.fxg4 f3 32.Rg3
