1.e4 {Notes by I. Gunsberg} c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Nc3 g6 4.d4 cxd4
5.Nxd4 Bg7 6.Be3 h5 {As it is White's object to advance his
f-Pawn, Black stands a chance of getting his h-Pawn isolated
and weakened through this advance.} 7.Be2 d6 8.Qd2 Bd7 9.O-O
Nf6 10.h3 Qc8 {As a matter of course Black aims at a King's
side attack, and h5 was intended to facilitate that
operation. We, however, think that the proper continuation of
the Sicilian must he on the Queen's side, by such moves as
Rc8, and Qa5 etc., the idea being also to utilise the Black
King's Bishop for an attack in the same direction crossways.}
11.f4 Kf8 {With what object is not clear. He exposes himself
to the coming advance by means of which White will be able to
free his f-file for the action of the Rook against the Black
King.} 12.Rad1 h4 13.Nxc6 Bxc6 14.e5 dxe5 15.fxe5 Nh5 16.Bg4
Qc7 17.Qf2 Be8 18.Nd5 {A fine and subtle move by which White
obtains a winning attack.} Qxe5 19.Nxe7 Bf6 {His only possible
reply against White's threat of Nxg6+ or Bc5.} 20.Nd5 Bg7
21.Bc5+ Kg8 22.Ne7+ Kh7 23.Rd5 {It is quite a pleasure to see
the way in which Dr. Tarrasch scientifically dissects his
opponent. The move hardly admits of a satisfactory reply, for
if the Queen moves away, Rxh5+, follows.} Ng3 24.Rxe5 Bxe5
25.Re1 Bxb2 26.Bd4 Bxd4 27.Qxd4 f5 28.Nxg6 {Neat again. If
...Bxg6, Re7+ wins.} 1-0
