1.d4 {Notes by Dr. Emanuel Lasker, condensed from those in
"Lasker's Chess Magazine", June 1906.} d5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.e3 c5
4.c4 e6 5.Nc3 dxc4 6.Bxc4 a6 7.a4 Nc6 8.O-O Nb4 {!?} 9.Qe2 b6
10.Rd1 Qc7 11.e4 {!} cxd4 12.Nxd4 Bc5 13.Bg5 {?! More relevant
is 13.Nb3, followed eventually by f3 and Be3. The bishop is
badly situated on g5 because Bxf6 is not a threat.} Bb7
14.Rac1 Rd8 15.Nb3 Rxd1+ 16.Rxd1 Bd6 17.a5 {!? A very deep
conception, which would have been much stronger the next move
(for example, after 17.g3).} b5 {!} 18.Bxb5+ {! Forced,
because if 18.Bd3, then 18...Bxh2+ and 19...Be5.} axb5 19.Nxb5
Bxh2+ 20.Kh1 Qb8 {There are many dangerous continuations at
White's disposal, but not one is killing: a) 21.g3? Bxg3
22.fxg3 Nxe4 and White is in trouble. b) 21.Bxf6 gxf6 22.g3?
Bxg3 23.fxg3 Qxg3 24.Nd6+ Ke7 25.Nxb7 Rg8 and White will be
mated. c) 21.f4 Bxf4 22.Bxf4 Qxf4 23.Nd6+ Ke7 24.Nxb7 Ng4
25.g3 Qxg3 26.Rf1 Nd3, etc. d) 21.Nc5 Bc6! 22.Nd4 Be5 and
Black's position is secure. e) 21.Qc4! (G. Marco) 21...Nc6!
(but not 21...Na6? 22.Nc5). In this variation White can only
make the situation more complicated, but still without any
advantage.} 21.Qd2 {? This continuation is weaker than
21.Qc4!. Now White is lost.} Na6 22.Bxf6 gxf6 23.Qd7+ Kf8
24.g3 Bxg3 25.fxg3 Bxe4+ 26.Kh2 Kg7 27.N3d4 Qe5 {!} 28.Nd6 {?
A blunder, but already there is no defense.} Qh5+ 29.Kg1 Qxd1+
