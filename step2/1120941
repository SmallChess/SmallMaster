10. Ba3 {A novelty by the leader of the White forces. White
intends to give up the piece in order to prevent Black from
castling into safety.} Be6 {Black declines the acceptance of
the sacrifice with doubtful judgement. If 10...dxc4 11 Re1 f5
12 Nd2 Kf7 13 Nxe4 fxe4 14 Rxe4 Qf6, (this appears to be the
only possible move as ...Re8 would be answered by Qh5+ and
...Bf5 by Rf4) 15 Qe2 Be6 (?) 16 Rae1 Rhe8 17 d5 and wins or

Kg6 18 d5 Ne5 19 Qxb7 Rhe8 and although Black is two Pawns
behind for the piece, and may lose a third, his attack is
excellent.} 11. Bb5 Nd6 12. Bxc6+ bxc6 13. Ne5 O-O 14. Nxc6
Qf6 {Black plays exceedingly well for position. It is with
best judgement that he allows White the opportunity of
doubling his Queen's Pawn, and White is wise to abstain from
it, as by doing so he would involve both his Knight and his
c-pawn in difficulties.} 15. Rb1 Bf5 16. Rb3 {The Rook ought
to have left the open file, as Rb4 would be answered by a5 ;
and the move actually made loses the exchange for a Pawn.} Bd7

22. Ne3 Qd7 23. d5 Rad8 24. Bb2 f6 25. Bd4 {A poor place for
the Bishop. It seems as though Ba3 would give him better
prospects of fixing his Pawns far ahead in the camp of his
adversary.} Nc8 26. Rd1 Nb6 27. d6 {A faulty combination,
which by opening up all lines to the Rooks endangers White's
game to a considerable extent. White probably expected to win
a Piece in case the Pawn was captured, but overlooked the
retort of Black’s 29th move regaining the Piece immediately.}
