1. e4 { Notes by Raymond Keene. } e5 {One of the very few
occasions on which I have played 1...e5 in a serious
tournament. The reason for this was that my study of Karpov's
games revealed that, if he had any weaknesses, it was a slight
hesitancy against 'Romantic' openings. It also seemed that
Karpov had never faced the Larsen Variation during his
tournament career, so I spent the morning prior to our game
examining the analysis of it given in Tim Harding's excellent
monograph on Philidor's Defence.} 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 exd4 4. Nxd4
{Morphy liked 4 Qxd4.} 4...g6 {The key move of Larsen's line.}
5. Nc3 Bg7 6. Be2 {?! Not the most aggressive course, which
consists of 6 Be3, followed by Qd2 and O-O-O. After Karpov's
move I already began to feel that my choice of opening had
been a qualified success.} 6...Nc6 7. Be3 Nf6 8. O-O O-O
9. Re1 Re8 {Employing the Nimzowitschian strategy of restraint
against White's e-pawn.} 10. Nxc6 bxc6 11. Bf3 Nd7 12. Qd2 Ba6
13. Rad1 Qb8 {Black has achieved a highly satisfactory
position from the opening, but that does not say so much when
playing Karpov. The then World Champion excelled in spotting
microscopic potential advantages, and, in addition, his
reactions were extremely swift, which meant that he could keep
up constant, rapid pressure on his opponent for long
periods. In fact, although we played 57 moves in our game,
they were all completed in the first session of five hours! In
such cases physical health often contributes as large a part
as chess strength to the final result.} 14. b3 Qb4 15. Nb1
Qxd2 16. Bxd2 Re7 17. Ba5 Ne5 {?! A superior way of defending
c7 is 17...Nb6, followed by ...Rae8, in order to tie White's
king's bishop to the defence of the e-pawn.} 18. Be2 Bxe2
19. Rxe2 Rae8 20. Kf1 c5 21. Bc3 Nc6 22. Bxg7 Kxg7 23. Nc3 Nd4
24. Red2 f5 {?! Possibly too impatient. Although this
liquidates White's e-pawn it also helps White in the eventual
creation of a kingside pawn majority.} 25. exf5 Nxf5 26. Re2
Rxe2 27. Nxe2 Kf7 28. Rd3 Rb8 29. g4 Ng7 30. Rf3+ Kg8 31. Nf4
c6 32. h4 Rb4 {? The plan was to force c2-c4, so that
eventually ...d6-d5 will give Black a passed pawn. After the
game Fridrik Olafsson criticised my idea as 'too systematic',
recommending the superior 32...Re8!} 33. c4 Rb7 {Now Black has
a difficult defensive task ahead, and I was also running into
time-trouble. Meanwhile Karpov was still moving at top speed
...} 34. Rd3 Rd7 35. Kg2 Kf7 36. Rf3 Kg8 37. Kg3 Re7 38. Rd3
Rd7 39. Ne2 Ne6 40. f4 Kf7 {Made it to the first time control,
but Karpov still had plenty of time in hand.} 41. Nc3 Ke7
42. Re3 Kf7 43. f5 {The long-expected passed pawn
materialises.} 43...gxf5 44. gxf5 Ng7 45. Kf4 Nh5+ 46. Kg5 Nf6
47. Re6 h6+ {!} 48. Kf4 {White is temporarily repulsed. If 48
Kxh6 Rd8 49 Kg5 Rg8+ 50 Kf4 Rg4+ 51 Ke3 Rxh4 52 Rxd6 Rh3+ 53
Kd2 Rxc3 54 Rxf6+ Kxf6 55 Kxc3 Ke5 and Black can hold the king
and pawn ending.} 48...d5 {!? Activity at last.} 49. cxd5 {?
Considering his huge time advantage Karpov should possibly
have sealed here, to make sure of victory. Instead he carried
on playing, almost without pause for thought. Much stronger is
49 Rxc6! dxc4 50 Rxc5 cxb3 51 axb3 when it's an open question
whether Black can resist after 51...Rd3!} 49...cxd5 {Here I
was in time-trouble again.} 50. Nb5 d4 {!} 51. Nd6+ Kg7
52. Ke5 d3 {! The saving resource, sacrificing a piece.}
53. Rxf6 d2 54. Rg6+ Kf8 {! Not 54...Kh7? 55 Rg1 Re7+ 56 Kf6
Re1 57 Rg7+ Kh8 58 Nf7 mate.} 55. Rg1 Re7+ {Was this what
Karpov overlooked on move 49?} 56. Kf6 Re1 57. Rg7 {!
57...d1=Q 58 Rf7+ Kg8 59 Rg7+ etc. is perpetual check. Apropos
Karpov's speed of play I quote Tony Miles in the New Statesman
of 1st April 1977: 'One of the most striking features of
Karpov's play is the speed at which he plays in relatively
simple technical positions. Against Ray Keene he played a
57-move game in 1 1/2 hours whilst his opponent survived two
time scrambles in one session taking 3 1/2 hours. Against
Olafsson the difference was even greater. After two sessions
of play the times were Karpov 2 hours, Olafsson 5. I do not
know the times at the end of the game, but in all probability
the difference was even greater - perhaps a record for modern
chess?'} 1/2-1/2
