1. e4 {Notes by J. Lowenthal} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. b4
d5 {It is a question of great importance, whether the Evans'
Gambit should be accepted or declined. In theory we have a
satisfactory defence against the regular attack; but in
practice this so invariably breaks down, that it would seem as
if, in matches were money and reputation are at stake, the
evasion of the gambit by the move in the text would be the
more prudent step.} 5. exd5 {5 Bb5 is the more usual move
here, and is followed up thus 5... dxe4 (best) 6 bxc5 exf3 7
Bxc6+ bxc6 8 Qxf3 Ne7 but even then White remains with a
somewhat inferior game.} Nxb4 6. O-O {Mr. Morphy considers
this best at this point.} Ne7 {6...Bf5 would have been the
proper play.} 7. Nxe5 O-O {we should have preferred ...Bd4.}
8. d4 Bd6 9. Nc3 Bf5 10. Bb3 a5 11. a3 a4 12. Nxa4 Nbxd5
13. c4 Rxa4 {In offering this sacrifice, Mr. Salmon was
probably impressed with the idea that his adversary would take
the rook and thus subject himself to the attack of ...Nc3 and
then ...Ne2+; but mr morphy evidently had all the variations
in his mind's eye, and so declined the proffered bait.}
14. cxd5 Ra5 15. Qf3 Bg6 16. Re1 Bb4 17. Re2 Nf5 18. Bb2 {The
accuracy and rapidity with which the young american replied at
this point of the game to the moves of his opponents, was the
subject of universal remark and astonishment.} Qa8 19. g3 Qa7
20. Nxg6 hxg6 21. Re5 Bxa3 22. d6 {Finely played; insuring the
advance of the wueen's pawn which is equivalent to the gain of
the game.} Bb4 {22....Nxd4 would have been bad play, as the
following variation will prove, eg. : 23 Bxf7+ Kh8 (best) 24
Qf4 Rxe5 25 Bxd4 and wins - 22...Nxd4 23 Bxf7+ Rxf7 24 Re8+
Kh7 (best) 25 Qxf7 Bxa3 and White mates in four moves.}
23. Rexa5 Bxa5 24. Qd5 b6 25. d7 Qa8 26. Rc1 Qxd5 27. Bxd5 b5
28. Bc6 Nd6 29. d5 Bd2 30. Rd1 Bg5 31. f4 Bd8 32. Ba3 f5
33. Re1 Kf7 34. Bxb5 Rh8 35. Bxd6 cxd6 36. Re8 {This ending
which is a perfect Chess study, deserves special attention
from the student.} Rf8 37. Kf2 g5 38. Ke3 g4 39. Kd3 g5
40. Bc6 gxf4 41. gxf4 Rg8 42. Kc4 Rf8 43. Kb5 Rg8 44. Ka6 Rf8
