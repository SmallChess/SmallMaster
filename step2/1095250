1.e4 {Notes by Frank Marshall In this tournament, I had
discovered, to my great amusement, that the Danish Gambit was
quite capable of cutting a wide swath among my young
opponents. They are at home in the Slv, Catalan, and other
modern wrinkles, but some of the older openings seem to baffle
them.} e6 {Levy, being an agressive and very gifted young
player, prefers to steer the game into different channels.}
2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Bb4 5.Nge2 {A good move. I don't care
for exd5, as I used to like Black's position after 5...Qxd5 in
the days when I played this defence.} h6 {? Deciding to
sacrifice a pawn; but the gambit has little to recommend it.}
6.Bxf6 Qxf6 7.a3 Bxc3+ 8.Nxc3 O-O 9.exd5 Re8 10.Be2 {dxe6 was
also feasible, but I prefer to seize the initiative as soon as
possible.} Qg5 11.Qd2 {! As long as I had to give back the
pawn, I preferred to do it in a manner which would either
yield a strong attack (as in the game) or else leave Black
without any play whatever (after ...Qxd2+).} Qxg2 12.O-O-O
exd5 {After 12...Qxf2 the strongest line would probably be h4
followed by harrying moves against the black queen. With such
an enormous lead in development and with a formidable attack,
White is bound to have an easy time of it in any event.}
13.Rdg1 Qxf2 {...Qh3 would not make much difference, as
White's attack would precede along similar lines.} 14.Rg3 Be6
15.Rf1 Qxh2 16.Qf4 Kh8 {White threatened Rxg7+. His attack has
become devastating.} 17.Bf3 {Another way was 17 Qe5! and Black
is helpless : 17...f6 18 Rxf6 Nd7 19 Rf8+ etc.; or 17...Rg8 18
Bd3! Nc6 19 Rxg7! winning the queen. However, the method
selected is just as quick.} Bf5 18.Bg2 Bg6 {This attempted
barricade collapses very rapidly, ruining Black's hope of
maintaining resistance after the loss of the queen.} 19.Rh1
Qxh1+ 20.Bxh1 Re1+ 21.Kd2 Rxh1 22.Rxg6 {! Crushes all
resistance.} fxg6 23.Qf8+ Kh7 24.Nxd5 {There is nothing to be
done about the coming Ne7.} 1-0
