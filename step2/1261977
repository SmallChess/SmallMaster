1. d4 {Notes by Nimzowitsch. This game illustrates the plan of
action "center file v. flank attack".} Nf6 2. Nf3 d6 3. c3
Nbd7 4. Bf4 c6 5. Qc2 Qc7 6. e4 e5 7. Bg3 Be7 {White has now
the attacking position in the center. This is unquestionably
an advantage. But here the weakness of his pawn at e4 (we
shall quickly see why e4 is weak) will soon force White to
surrender his advantage; that is to say he will find himself
obliged to equalize with dxe5.} 8. Bd3 O-O 9. Nbd2 Re8 {!}
10. O-O Nh5 {In order to exchange the bishop.} 11. Nc4 Bf6
12. Ne3 Nf8 13. dxe5 {Since the Bishop is needed at d3 for the
protection of the e-pawn, the d-pawn can only be protected
against a Knight at e6 by exchanging him. The student should
consider carefully the motif here used, aiming at forcing the
opponent to declare himself (whether for dxe5 or for d5).}
dxe5 14. Bh4 Qe7 15. Bxf6 Qxf6 16. Ne1 Nf4 {? With this move a
diversion is put 'en train' which may be said to run counter
to the spirit of the opening. The right line of play consisted
in ...Be6 and doubling the rooks on the d-file. By this means
advantage could have been taken of the rather uncomfortable
position of White's bishop at d3. Black's simplest course
would have been to play ...Be6 on his 14th move.} 17. g3 Nh3+
18. Kh1 h5 19. N3g2 g5 20. f3 Ng6 21. Ne3 {!} h4 22. g4 {??
The entry of the knight at f5 would, according to my analysis,
have decided the game in White's favor. The retreat of the
Black knight at h3 is cut off. The attempt at a rescue
undertaken by means of a wreckless advance of the k side pawns
gives the opportunity, often ocurring in such a position, for
a decisive counter stroke, by an invasion in the center, in
the present case by ...Nf4. For instance 22 Nf5 hxg3 23 hxg3
Bxf5 24 exf5 Ne7 25 Kg2 Kg7 (is the pawn sacrifice 25...g4 26
fxg4 Ng5 any better?) 26 Kxh3 Rh8+ (or 26...Nd5 27 Qe2) 27 Kg2
Qh6 28 Kf2 Qh2+ 29 Ng2 Rh3 30 Ke1 Rxg3 31 Ne3, etc. Moreover
as a superabundance 26 Rh1 is also playable, which I showed to
be a win for White in an analysis I published in the 'Rigaer
Rundschau'.} Nhf4 {Now the knight rejoices in his rediscovered
freedom, and black, after this doubtful excursion, which could
easily have ended fatally for him, takes up the right line,
play in the queen file, and pursues it with complete masterly
to victory. What remains needs but few remarks.} 23. Rf2 Nxd3
