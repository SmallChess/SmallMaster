1.e4 {Notes by R. Teichmann} e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.Nc3 Nf6
5.d3 d6 6.Be3 Bb6 7.Qd2 Be6 8.Bb5 {Entirely against the spirit
of the exchange of the King's Bishop for the Black Queen's
Knight is itself ill-judged, and besides strengthens the Black
centre Pawns.} O-O 9.Bxc6 bxc6 10.Bg5 {Losing another move.}
Ba5 11.a3 c5 12.O-O Rb8 13.Rfb1 c6 14.h3 Kh8 15.Qc1 {White’s
play is somewhat eccentric and without any set plan. Qe2
followed by Bd2 appears to be preferable.} h6 16.Be3 Ng8
17.Ne2 f5 {Black has now an excellent development, and with
this move inaugurates a strong attack.} 18.exf5 Bxf5 19.Nh2
Bb6 20.Ng3 Bc8 {He prefers this to Be3 in order to be able to
play d5 in answer to 21 Ne4,viz.: 21 Ne4 d5 22 Nxc5(?) d4,
winning a Piece which would not have been feasible with the
Bishop at e6.} 21.Qd1 Rb7 22.Qh5 Rbf7 23.Rf1 Qc7 24.c4 {This
makes the Queen's Pawn fixed and weak; but it is difficult to
suggest a satisfactory line of play for White.} Ne7 25.Qe2 Ng6
26.Qd2 Nf4 27.f3 d5 28.Bxf4 exf4 29.Ne2 Rd8 30.Qc3 {In this
position Dr. Tarrasch, under the impression that he had made
his 30th move already, exceeded his time, and the game was
claimed by Mason. There can be no doubt that, on the merits of
the position, Dr. Tarrasch ought to have won the game. The
simplest plan seems to be to double the Rooks on the King's
file, after which White seems quite hopeless; the scope of his
Knights being very limited and a defence of the weak Queen's
pawn in the long run impossible. (Mr. Mason drew his
opponent's attention to his clock more than once, and imformed
him that he had only made twenty-nine moves, but unfortunately
the doctor had written his name at move one, and was sure he
had made thirty moves.- ED)} 1-0
