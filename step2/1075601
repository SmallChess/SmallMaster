1. e4 {Notes by Lowenthal} e5 2. f4 Bc5 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. b4 {A
move first adopted by the editor in his match with Harrwitz;
it leads to most interesting positions.} Bxb4 5. c3 Ba5 6. Bc4
Bb6 7. d4 exd4 8. cxd4 d6 9. Bb2 f6 10. f5 {A very good move,
and one that so hampers Black's game as to render the
development of his pieces a matter of much difficulty.} Qe7
{Had his lordship, with the intention of breaking up the
pawns, played ...g6, White , in replying g4, would have
maintained his superior position. Neither would ...Nh6 have
availed more for the second player.} 11. O-O Bd7 12. Nc3
{Preparing to post the knight on d5, and thus get rid of the
adverse king's bishop, which commands an important diagonal.}
O-O-O 13. Re1 Qe8 14. Nd5 g6 15. Nxb6+ axb6 16. Qa4 Na5
{...Nb8 would perhaps have been better.} 17. Qa3 c6 18. Bd3
Qf8 {...Kc7 would have been bad on account of the rejoinder of
e5.} 19. Bc3 {Placing Black's game in an irrecoverably lost
position.} Kc7 20. Bxa5 Ra8 21. Bxb6+ Kxb6 22. Rab1+ Kc7
23. Qb3 {As this is all played blindfold, the accuracy shown
is most astonishing.} Rb8 24. Qb6+ Kc8 25. Ba6 {Finely played
again.} Ne7 26. e5 {26 Qa7 might also have been played with
great effect, e.g. : 26.Qa7 Kf7 27 Bxa6 winning in a few
moves, or 26.Qa7 d5 27 Bxb7+ Kf7 (If 27...Rxb7 28 Qa8+ Kf7 29
Rxb7+ Kd6 30 Qa3+ and mates next move) 28 Bc8+ and mating in
two moves.} dxe5 27. Bxb7+ Rxb7 28. Qxb7+ Kd8 29. dxe5 1-0
