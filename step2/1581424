{Morphy's, after leaving New York, almost completely withdrew
from chess playing, coupled with Fiske resigning from the
Chess Monthly resulted in a great loss of interest in chess in
this country. The events leading up to the Civil War were
followed intensely by Paul which made matters worse. However,
these events did not affect the chess scene abroad where
possibly a worthy challenger was making his own name
known. Four games with Harrwitz where Harrwitz won 1, lost two
and drew 1 before again taking sick. Against de Riviere 5-5
tie and in London equally sucessful. Kolisch then wanted to
challenge Morphy and found a backer in Baron Rothschild. The
Illustraded London Times of March 16 1861 announced that a
challange for L 500 a side had been forwarded to Morphy. Paul
declined the match, and further stated that should he ever
again be in Europe he may make a special exception to his rule
of playing no more matches, but if he were to do so that
absolutely no stakes would be involved.} 1-0
