1.e4 {Notes by Emanuel Lasker} e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 d6 4.d4 Bd7
5.Nc3 Nf6 6.O-O Be7 7.Bg5 {This seems stronger than the
customary 7 Re1.} exd4 8.Nxd4 O-O 9.Bxc6 bxc6 10.Qd3 Re8
11.Rae1 c5 12.Nb3 Ng4 {12...Rb8 (with the intention of
embarrasing the Knight by the attack on the b-pawn) could be
countered by 13 Bc1, and White will still be able to fortify
his center by f4.} 13.Bxe7 Rxe7 14.f4 Rb8 15.h3 Nh6 16.f5
{White could have achieved more by 16 g4 which would have
avoided yielding e5 and g5 to Black. The text move seemed to
have the advantage of getting the King's Rook into play via f4
and of keeping the g-file open for the Queen.} f6 17.Nd5 Re8
18.c4 Nf7 19.Qc3 Re5 20.Nd2 c6 21.Nf4 Qb6 22.b3 Rbe8 23.Qg3
Kh8 24.Nh5 Rg8 25.Rf4 Qd8 26.Nf3 Re7 27.Rh4 {27 Rg4 could have
been adequately countered by ...Qf8.} Qe8 28.Qf2 {Even though
Black suffers from a cramped position there is no immediate
winning combination available for White. Hence, the Black
pieces must be disorganised by tactical manoeuvres before the
attack can be resumed.} Rf8 29.Qd2 Qb8 30.Kh1 Rfe8 31.Rg4 Rg8
32.Rd1 Qb4 33.Qf2 Qc3 34.Qh4 Nh6 35.Rf4 Nf7 36.Kh2 Rge8 37.Qg3
Rg8 38.Rh4 g5 {The threat was 39 Nf4 Nh6 40 Rxd6.} 39.fxg6
{Rg4 could have been countered by Be8.} Rxg6 40.Qf2 f5 41.Nf4
Rf6 42.Ne2 Qb2 43.Rd2 Qa1 44.Ng3 Kg8 {The threat was 45 exf5
Bxf5 46 Nxf5 Rxf5 47 Rxh7+.} 45.exf5 Bxf5 46.Nd4 {! Decisive.}
cxd4 47.Nxf5 Kf8 48.Qxd4 Qxd4 49.Nxd4 Ne5 50.Rh5 Ref7 51.c5
dxc5 52.Rxe5 cxd4 53.Rxd4 Rf2 54.Rd8+ Kg7 55.Ra5 Rc2 56.a3
{Naturally, since ...Rff2 would have won the important
a-pawn.} c5 57.Rc8 Rb2 58.Rb5 Rff2 59.Rb7+ Kg6 60.Rc6+ Rf6
61.Rxc5 Ra6 62.a4 Rf6 {62...Rxa4 would be followed by 63 Rc6+
followed by Rb5+ and bxa4.} 63.Rc3 a6 64.Rg3+ Kh6 65.Rgg7 1-0
