1. e4 {Annotation by T. Palmer, as appeared in Quarterly
Newsletter of the West Michigan Chess Association. Vol V, Iss
3, Summer 2012} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Nxe4
{The Ruy Lopez Open, which has always enjoyed a slightly dodgy
reputation for Black.} 6. d4 b5 7. Bb3 d5 8. dxe5 Be6 9. Nbd2
{9. c3 Bc5 is another Main Line.} Nc5 10. c3 g6!? {The
chessgames database has 461 games here, with 10...Be7 most
common, then 10...d4 and 10...Bg4. I chose this sideline
trying to follow a recent Black win by GM Nigel Short.}
11. Bc2 {Karpov-Korchnoi (World Championship, Baguio City
1978) continued 11. Qe2 Bg7 12. Nd4 Nxe5 13. f4 Nc4 14. f5
gxf5 15. Nxf5 Rg8 16. Nxc4 dxc4 17. Bc2 and White won (1-0,
28). Nijboer-Sokolov (Hilversum, 2006) went 11. Nd4 Nxe5
12. Bc2 Bg7 13. f4 Nc4 14. Nxc4 dxc4 15. f5 gxf5 16. Nxe6 Nxe6
17. Qh5 and White won (1-0, 21) after a Black
blunder. Kashdan-Ulvestad (US Championship, New York 1946) saw
11. Qe2 Bg7 12. Bc2 O-O 13. Nb3 Nxb3 14. Bxb3 Re8 15. Bf4 Na5
16. Nd4 Qd7 and drawn (53).} Bg7 12. Re1 O-O {Rogovoi-Petrov
(Tallinn, 2001) continued 12...Nd7 13. Nf1 Ncxe5 14. Nxe5 Nxe5
15. f4 Nc4 16. f5 gxf5 17. Qh5 Qf6 18. Bxf5 Kd7 and Black won
(0-1, 48). Fritz 7 Deep Position Analysis suggests 12...Nd7
13. Nd4 Nxd4 14. cxd4 O-O 15. Nf3 with equality [0.22/16].}
13. Nb3 Nd7 {Gilg-Schmitzer (Bad Aibling, 1962) saw Black play
13...Nxb3 14. Bxb3 Na5 15. Bc2 c5 16. Bg5 Qc7 17. Bf4 Rad8
18. a4 and White won (1-0, 35).} 14. Bf4 {Efimenko-Short
(Mukachevo, 2009) went 14. Bg5 Qc8 15. Bf4 Ne7 16. Qd2 c5
17. Bh6 Qc6 18. Qg5 Rfe8 and Black won (0-1, 52).} Ne7
15. Nbd4 c5 16. Nxe6 fxe6 {Usually this N for B trade works
out pretty well for Black, with the Pd5 now protected and the
f file half open for attack, but White generates strong
Kingside play.} 17. Ng5 Qb6 {17...Rxf4?! 18. Nxe6 wins the
exchange and a Pawn since Qf8 is out.} 18. Qg4 Nf5 19. h4
h5!? {A definite positional concession, trying to hold my
Kingside together at all costs.} 20. Qh3 Rae8 {Well, at least
I made it to twenty moves! =)} 21. g4 hxg4 22. Qxg4 Nh6
23. Qg3 Nf5 24. Qh3 {White plays for a win, instead of any
potential repetition with 23. Qg4 Nh6 etc.} Re7 25. h5 Nd4 {
Drat: my saving idea turns out to be a lemon. Fritz 7
recommends Black try a Pawn sacrifice with 25...Bh6 26. hxg6
Rg7 +/=. Otherwise the engine had no improvements before
now.} 26. cxd4 Rxf4 27. h6! {I missed this possibility.} Bf8
28. Bxg6 Rxd4? {Another error per Fritz 7, but the suggestion
28...cxd4 29. Rad1 d3 is +-.} 29. Re3 c4 {By now, both players
know that White will win. GM Adams patiently builds up his
attack toward the big finish.} 30. Rae1 Rd2 {Fritz sayeth 30...Kh8 31. Rf3 Qa5 +- which might have held out longer.} 31. Rf3
Rxb2 32. Nf7 Rxf7 {Desperation, but 32...Nxe5? 33. h7+ Kg7
34. Qh6# is no better.} 33. Bxf7+ Kh8 34. Qg3 {A deadly quiet
move, as White mates quickly.} 1-0
