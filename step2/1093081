1.e4 {Notes by Geza Maroczy} c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 g6
5.Be3 Bg7 6.c4 {Black opened the game very badly, earlier he
should have played ...Nf6 in order to force Nc3. White's move
is very strong, it impedes d5 and breaks up the QB diagonal.}
d6 7.Nc3 Nf6 8.Be2 Bd7 9.O-O O-O 10.f4 Ng4 {A blunder. Black
remenbered that ...Ng4 could be played, but he did not know
that it should not be made in this position.} 11.Bxg4 Bxg4
12.Nxc6 Qd7 13.Nxe7+ Kh8 14.Qd3 Qxe7 {Black has lost a pawn,
and has a bad game otherwise. The game is decided.} 15.Nd5 Qd7
