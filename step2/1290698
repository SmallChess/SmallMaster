5.d4 Be7 6.Qe2 Nd6 7.Bxc6 bxc6 8.dxe5 Nb7 9.b3 O-O 10.Bb2 d5
11.exd6 {This gives away White's opening advantage by
consolidating the opponent's game. 11 Nbd2 was indicated.}
cxd6 12.Nbd2 Re8 {! The R here threatens the White Q, and it
is interesting to see how quickly that indirect menace gives
Black some decisive advantage.} 13.Rfe1 Bd7 14.Ne4 {This turns
out to be ineffective. It would have been relatively best to
retreat the Q to f1, the only if modest place where she could
enjoy a little peace.} d5 15.Ned2 {The Kt mustn't go to g3,
since Bb4 would cost the exchange.} Ba3 16.Be5 f6 17.Qa6
{White just manages to avoid the loss of a piece.} fxe5
18.Qxa3 e4 19.Nd4 Qf6 20.c3 Rf8 21.f3 Qg5 {One blow after
another Lasker plays with great strength.} 22.Qc1 Nc5 23.Nf1
Qg6 24.Re3 Nd3 25.Qd1 Nf4 26.Ng3 h5 27.Nde2 Nxg2 {! Forcing
the issue with an elegant combination.} 28.Kxg2 exf3+ 29.Rxf3
Bh3+ 30.Kxh3 Qg4+ 31.Kg2 Qxf3+ 32.Kg1 h4 33.Nh1 Qe3+ {Resigns,
since Kg2 is punished by the pretty mate ...h3.} 0-1
