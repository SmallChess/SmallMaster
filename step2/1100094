5. Bxf6 Qxf6 6. Nc3 c6 7. e3 Nd7 8. Bd3 Bb4 9. O-O Bxc3
10. bxc3 dxc4 11. Bxc4 e5 {He should have castled first before
making this move. Now White will have the better endgame.}
12. dxe5 Nxe5 13. Nxe5 Qxe5 14. Qd4 Qxd4 15. exd4 Be6 {The
lesser evil since 15...0—0, could be answered by 16 Rfe1
followed by Re7.} 16. Rfe1 Kd7 17. Bxe6+ fxe6 18. Re5 Rhf8
19. Rae1 Rae8 20. f3 Rf5 21. Kf2 Rxe5 22. Rxe5 {This Rook
ending is far from easy for Black but it is by no means lost
yet.} b5 23. Ke3 Rb8 24. h4 Rb6 25. a4 {! Evidently Black's
counter manoeuvre has not availed him much but now he should
play b4 so as at least to keep his Rook mobile after 26 cxb4
Rxb4 27 Ra5 Rb2, etc.} a5 26. Kd3 Rb8 27. Kc2 Rb7 28. c4 bxa4
29. Rxa5 Rb4 30. Kd3 Kc7 31. c5 Kb7 32. Ke4 h5 33. g4 hxg4
34. fxg4 g6 35. Ke5 Rc4 36. h5 {? One of the very rare cases
of Lasker playing an ending with lack of precision and thereby
enabling the opponent to force the draw by a subtle
manoeuvre. White could have won quite easily by 36 b5.} gxh5
37. gxh5 Rc1 {? Black misses his opportunity. It was only in
the post mortem that Spielmann found out how he could have
drawn the game here by 37...Rb4! 38 h6 Rb3! 39 Rxa4 Rh3 40 Kd6
Rxh6, etc.} 38. Rxa4 Rh1 39. Kd6 Rxh5 40. Rb4+ Kc8 41. Kxc6
