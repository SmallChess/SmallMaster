1. e4 {Notes by Bogoljubov} c5 2. Nc3 e6 3. Nf3 d6 4. g3 {With
4 d4 cxd4 5 Nxd4 etc. he could enter well-trodden paths.} Nf6
5. Bg2 Be7 6. O-O O-O 7. b3 {White is trying to avoid the
weakness of c4, so often a source of embarrassment of this
opening.} Nc6 8. Bb2 Bd7 9. d4 cxd4 10. Nxd4 Qa5 11. Qd2 Rac8
12. Rad1 Kh8 {So as to guard against the threat 13 Nxc6
followed by Nxd5.} 13. Nce2 {!} Qxa2 {A rather odd combination
of Lasker's which happens to turn out very well indeed; yet,
it was fairly risky to give up the Q for and R and a B even
thoughBlack does secure a fairly sound position. Lasker
probably wished to avoid the exchange of Queens because he
considered it to give White a superior position.} 14. Ra1 Qxb2
15. Rfb1 Qxb1+ 16. Rxb1 Rfd8 17. c4 Ne8 18. f4 {White is
trying to force matters thereby weakening his K position a
very much safer move was 18 Nxc6.} a6 19. Kh1 Nc7 20. Qe3 Rb8
21. Rd1 Nb4 {Whereas Black is strengthening his position with
every move White seems to shove around his pieces rather
aimlessly.} 22. Qc3 a5 23. Ra1 {That Rook had no business
here!} b6 24. Qe3 {? A regrettable mistake thereby cutting
short a game that had promised to become very interesting and
instructive.} e5 {! Black now wins the exchange and thereafter
the ending presents no trouble at all.} 25. Nf5 Bxf5 26. exf5

great tactician, at his very shrewdest.} 0-1
