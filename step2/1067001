1. e4 {Notes by Ray Keene.} c6 2. d4 d5 3. Nd2 dxe4 4. Nxe4
Nf6 5. Nxf6+ gxf6 6. Nf3 Bf5 7. Bf4 {!? This was a new move at
the time, but the idea was old. It was just a matter of 6 Bc4
usually being played first. 7 Be2 Qc7 8 O-O e6 9 c4 Nd7 10 d5
O-O-O is Spassky-Larsen, Buenos Aires 1979.} Nd7 {On 7...Qb6
White might try 8 Bd3, which is a promising gambit. 7...Na6,
intending to transfer the knight to c7, comes into
consideration. 7...Qb6 8 Bd3 Bxd3 9 Qxd3 Qxb2 10 O-O with
compensation; 7...Na6.} 8. c3 {8 Bd3 Bg6} Qb6 9. b4 {!? On 9
Qb3 Black could either castle long or just play 9...e6. In the
later game Karpov-Miles, Oslo 1984, the World Champion essayed
the promising gambit 9 Bd3!?} e5 {As usual, a reckless advance
on the flank is met by a counter-operation in the centre.}
10. Bg3 {10 dxe5 fxe5 (10...O-O-O!? with compensation) 11 Nxe5
Bg7 =+} O-O-O 11. Be2 h5 {! This is a fully justified kingside
operation, since the Bg3 is vulnerable.} 12. O-O Be4 {Perhaps
this was not the best move, but Miles did not want to face
12...Bg4 13 Bh4 Bxf3 14 Bxf3 exd4 when the pawn-grabbing could
prove expensive.} 13. Nd2 {On 13 Bh4 Black could have played
13...Rg8! intending to infiltrate on g4.} Bd5 {Miles was
eating up the clock here. There seems to be a difference of
opinion on the line 13...Bxg2!? 14 Kxg2 h4 15 Bf4! exf4. Miles
thought it was about equal, but Karpov claimed an advantage
for White. On 13...Bg6 the players could head for a draw with
14 Nf3 Be4, though that result was unlikely, since this was a
sudden death game.} 14. Bxh5 exd4 15. c4 Be6 16. a3 {White has
a generally more compact pawn structure, but Black has
counterplay in the centre with his passed d-pawn.} Ne5
{Freeing d4 for the queen.} 17. Re1 d3 18. c5 Qb5 19. Rb1
{Karpov later pointed out 19 Bxe5 fxe5 20 Rxe5 Bg7 21 Bxf7!
Bxe5 22 Bxe6+ Kb8 23 Bc4 Bxh2+ 24 Kf1 Be5 25 Kg1 Bh2+ with a
draw. Miles provided 20 Bg4! Rh6 21 Rxe5! Bg7 22 Bxe6+ fxe6 23
Re4! Bxa1 24 a4! Qa6 25 Qxa1 with an excellent position for
the exchange.} Bh6 20. a4 Qa6 {Unclear.} 21. f4 {!?} Nc4
22. b5 cxb5 23. Rxb5 {This move took Miles by surprise. He had
been expecting 23 axb5 Qa2 unclear.} Na3 {! 23...Nxd2 24 Qxd2
Qxa4 25 Reb1 Qc2? [25...Bd5] 26 Qa5 d2 [26...Bd5 27 R5b2 +-]
27 Bd1! +-} 24. Rb2 {There are a lot of tempting sacrificial
lines, but none of them works.} Nc2 {Perhaps 24...Bf8
(intending 25...Bxc5+ 26 Kh1 Nc2) would have been better, but
Miles was influenced by the fact that Karpov was
uncharacteristically short of time, having about two minutes
left for 16 moves.} 25. Bf3 Bd5 26. Re7 Bf8 27. Bxd5 Rxd5 {Now
logical was 28 Rexb7 Bxc5+ 29 Bf2! and Black could have tried
to hold a draw with 29...Qxb7 or head for muddy waters with
29...Bb6!? 30 R7xb6 or Rxf7. For example, 28 Rexb7 Bxc5+ 29
Bf2! (29 Kh1 Bb6 30 Rxf7 Ne3 with initiative) 29...Bxf2+
(29...Bb6!? 30 R7xb6/Rxf7; 29...Qxb7) 30 Kxf2 Qxa4 (30...Qxb7
=) 31 Qg4+! f5 32 Qg5! (intending Rb8+) 32...Qd4+ 33 Kg3 Qe3+
34 Nf3 +-.} 28. Rbxb7 {? A blunder. He must take with the
other rook.} Bxe7 29. Rxe7 Qc6 {!} 30. Rxf7 Rxc5 {30...f5!
would have stopped any counterplay.} 31. Qg4+ f5 {only move;
31...Kb8? 32 f5+ Ka8 33 Qg7 +-} 32. Qg7 {? 32 Rxf5 was obvious
and good. Karpov must have been in a state of panic.} Re8
33. h4 {33 h3 would have held out longer, but White would lose
in the end: h3 Ne3 34 Bf2 Rc1+ 35 Kh2 Qxg2+ 36 Qxg2 Nxg2 37
Kxg2 Rc2 -+} Ne3 34. Bf2 Rc1+ 35. Kh2 Ng4+ 36. Kg3 Nxf2
37. Nf3 {If 37 Kxf2 Re2+ and ...Qxg2 mate.} Ne4+ 38. Kh2 d2
39. Nxd2 Nxd2 {Here Karpov's flag fell and Karpov shook
hands. Was it a resignation or loss on time? Miles didn't
care; he had collected the point. A most unclear game.} 0-1
