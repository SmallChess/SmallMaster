1. c4 {Notes by International Grandmaster Raymond Keene.} Nf6
2. Nc3 d6 3. d4 g6 4. e4 Bg7 5. Be2 O-O 6. Nf3 {The Classical
Variation, in which the strong zones for both players are
defined clearly once the centre has been dixed: White achieves
play on the Q-side while Black seeks an attack on the opposite
wing.} e5 7. d5 Nbd7 8. Bg5 {Petrosian's own line, which
provokes an immediate challenge to this bishop as White
threatens 9. Qd2. For some years Petrosian earned his living
by playing this variation, which at one point seemed to
invalidate the whole defense until resources were found.} h6
9. Bh4 a6 {At this stage there are many complex lines. If
9...g5 10. Bg3 Nh5 White can choose the positional 11. Nd2 Nf4
12. O-O Nc5 13. Nb3 or try for a direct assault on the black
king with 11. h4. Stein's idea is to unpin the knight on f6 by
moving the queen, having first guarded against Nb5. That way
the g-pawn can stay where it is, and Black might be able to
bring about a more usual advance on the flank by thrusting
forward with the f-pawn.} 10. O-O Qe8 11. Nd2 c5 {This is very
committal, but Black already has problems relating to
development. For example, if aims for a quick ...f5 by means
of 11...Nh7 12. Rc1 f5 13. exf5 gxf5 14.Bh5 he may not be
quite ready for the exchange sacrifice, almost identical to
this, seen in Yusupov-Kasparov, Barcelona 1989, when Black was
better developed and should have won.} 12. dxc6 bxc6 13. b4
Rb8 14. a3 {Consolidating his position. Black's d-pawn is
vulnerable and the light-square bishop presently has no good
location. Stein's one hope is to create complications that
might nullify any positional defect in the spate of a full
onslaught.} Bb7 15. Nb3 Qe6 16. Na5 {Black's difficulties are
highlighted by this move. If 16...Rfc8 17.Nxb7 Rxb7 18.c5
White wins. Or 16...Ne8 17.Nd5! cxd5 (17...g5 18.Bg4) 18.cxd5
Bxd5 19.exd5 Qf5 20.Bg4 Qf4 21.Bg3} Ba8 {The bishop now
becomes locked behind the pawn at c6, never to move
again. After this, Stein launches his attack, there being
nothing else to play for.} 17. f3 d5 {Here it comes, yet White
simply has to avoid 18.cxd5? to secure a lasting initiative.}
18. c5 {!} Nh5 19. Bxa6 {The first fruit, but of course Black
is no longer concerned about minor material loss.} Nf4 20. Ne2
g5 21. Bf2 f5 22. Rc1 {As one would expect, Petrosian defends
calmly, relying on the inherent soundness of his position to
negate Black's desperate efforts to break through.} fxe4
23. fxe4 Nf6 {The impulsive 23...dxe4 loses at once to 24.Nxf4
followed by 25.Bc4} 24. exd5 N6xd5 {Unfortunately for Black,
the one change to release the encarcerated bishop by 24...cxd5
allows 25.c6!} 25. Ng3 e4 {Denying White the use of e4 while
liberating the dark square bishop and planning to leap into d4
with a knight. The drawback is that d4 becomes available to
the other side.} 26. Bd4 Rbd8 27. Bxg7 Kxg7 28. Qd4+ Nf6
29. Qc3 Kg6 {After all Black's forceful play, it is HIS king
that has become insecure.} 30. Nc4 Nd3 {30...Rd3 is answered
by 31.Ne5+} 31. Rcd1 Nd5 32. Qc2 {A climax has been
reached. If now 32...N5f4 33.Nd6 is sufficient to steam any
threat based on the e-pawn's desire to push on. Or 32...N5xb4,
when 33.axb4 Nxb4 34.Qa4 e3 35.Nd6 Nxa6 36.Qxe6 Qe5 37.Qc4
wins.} Nc7 33. Nd6 {!} Nxa6 34. Rxf8 Rxf8 35. Ndxe4 Naxb4 {If
instead ...Nf4 then 36.Rd6.} 36. axb4 Nxb4 37. Qb1 {A quiet
retreat that maintains the power to deliver a discovered
check.} Nd5 38. Re1 {One more sotto voce move on the back rank
which leaves black with no adequate reply.} Qd7 {If 38...Kg7
39.Nh5+ Kh8 40.Qa1+ and wins--as played white sacs his knight
to give the long prepared discovered check and forces the
win.} 39. Nf6+ 1-0
