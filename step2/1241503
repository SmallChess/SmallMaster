{This allows Black to bring out the Queen’s Bishop without any
difficulty.} Bf5 5.Nc3 e6 6.Bd3 Bxd3 7.Qxd3 Nbd7 8.O-O Bd6
9.e4 dxe4 10.Nxe4 Nxe4 11.Qxe4 O-O 12.Bd2 Qf6 13.Rad1 Qg6

19.h4 Kf7 20.g3 Nd7 21.Be3 Nb6 22.Rc1 Nc8 23.Re2 Ne7 {All
these maneuvers with the Knight are extremely difficult to
explain fully. The student would do well to carefully analyze
them. Black’s position might now be said to be unassailable.}
24.Rc3 a6 25.a4 Rab8 26.b4 b5 {Bd6 was better, as it gave
Black some slightly winning chances.} 27.cxb5 axb5 28.a5 Bd6
29.Rb3 Nd5 30.Bd2 Rdc8 {The game was given up for a draw,
because having analyzed the game during the twenty-four hour’s
interval, we both came to the conclusion that it was
impossible to win the game for either side.} 1/2-1/2
