line before only once (although 9.O-O-O is his favourite
line). Although it was never considered very dangerous for
Black by the theory, the present game may change the
evaluation, or at least Black will have to look for better
ways to prove compensation for the pawn.'} Qc7 14. Qc5 Qb7 {

not forced to put the Rook on b8. After 15.Qa3 he has to play

19. Rd3 {Rogozenko: 'White's strategy becomes clear: he will
take control over d-file and protect the King by playing
c4. The Queen on a3 plays an important role in protecting the
King along the diagonal a1-h8. In fact White has a solid
position and at the same time obvious possibilities for active
play.'} Qc6 20. c4 Qf6 21. Rhd1 $3 {This is the main point of
the Ivanchuk's discovery: black threats along the black
diagonal are not too dangerous.} Rc6 {Too optimistic. Black
threatens to win the game by Ra6 - this threat is easy to
repel. Instead I would suggest 21...Rcd8 - just to change a

will just exchange Queens (by activating white Queen) and the
