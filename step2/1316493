Nc6 5. Bb5 Bd7 6. Bxc6 Bxc6 7. Bg5 f6 8. Bh4 Nh6 {It is a
question to which square this knight should be played here, to
the one in the text or to e7. Much may be said in favor of
both; played to h6 it can be brought back to f7 and castling
effected; while if to e7 with the object of posting it on g6,
a diagonal is left open which will render castling a less easy
matter. The relative merit, however, of the two moves can only
be determined by frequently testing them in actual play.}

{Played, it would seem, with a view of occupying the square
vacated with the queen's rook, though we do not see that
Black's position would thereby have been much improved.}
14. f4 {In recording games played by Mr. Morphy, we have been
much struck by the skill and judgement with which he
invariably times the advance of the f-pawn after castling. An
immediate advantage is immediately apparent. Here it allows
the King's rook to be brought to bear on the adversary's
intrenchments.} a5 15. f5 Rff8 {The advance of the f-pawn by
white effectually prevented Black from carrying on his
original plan of bringing his queen's rook to f8 on account of
Ne6; and this retreat of the king's rook was no doubt caused
by Baucher's wish to bring his knight into play, which he now
could not do without leaving this rook 'en prise'.} 16. Ne6
{White has now a fine game.} Rg8 17. a4 Ng4 18. Qe2
{Mr. Morphy exhibits the true spirit of chess. From the
commencement of the game he makes such a disposition of his
pieces, that, after serving his purpose to the utmost in their
original position, they are brought at once, and without the
least loss of time, to bear on another weak point in the
adversary's game. The move in the text is a fair proof of the
truth of the assertion; for the queen, after for some time
having maintained a position of importance, is now brought
back and becomes even more powerful than before. This move is
a commencement of a very masterly combination.} Ne5 19. Bg3
Qc8 {To get rid of the knight by playing ...Bd7 and to allow
the d-pawn to take the bishop if his knight were captured.}
20. Bxe5 dxe5 21. Rf3 {The key move to a combination of
surprising merit, when it is remembered that it takes place in
a game contested simultaneously with seven others against
strong players, and all without sight of board and men.} Bd7
22. Rh3 h6 {If 22...Re8 White would have won as follows 23 Qh5
h6 24 Nxg7 Bf8 (We see no better move for if ...Kg8 white
would win with Rg3) 25 Qxh6+ Kg8 26 Qh7+ Kf7 and White mates
in two moves.} 23. Qd2 {Followed up with real spirit.} Kh7 {To
save the threatened mate.} 24. Qxd7 Bd6 25. Rxh6+ {The
position deserves the student's best examination. Mr. Morphy's
play here is a wonderful exhibition of brilliancy and
correctness.} Kxh6 26. Rd3 Kh5 27. Qf7 Kh4 28. Rh3 Kg4
