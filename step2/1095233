1.c4 {Notes by Frank Marshall} Nf6 2.Nc3 e6 3.Nf3 d5 4.d4 Bb4
{We have reached a Queen's Gambit Declined in somewhat a
devious manner. After the timid reply that follows, Black is
at once certain of a satisfactory position.} 5.e3 O-O 6.Bd3 c5
{Freeing his position and disputing the control of the
center.} 7.O-O dxc4 8.Bxc4 a6 9.dxc5 {If 9 a3 Bxc3 10 bxc3 b5
11 Bd3 Bb7 leaving Black with an excellent position, despite
his opponent's two bishops.} Bxc5 10.Qc2 {? White's enterprise
in avoiding a probably quick draw after 10 Qxd8 is laudable,
but the move he selects is faulty. 10 Qe2 was in order, as it
would have avoided the two drawbacks of the text : putting
Black's queen on a file where it will later be opposed by a
black rook, and giving up the protection of White's king
knight, which will later lead to a weakening of the
king-side.} b5 11.Rd1 Qe7 12.Bd3 {Be2 would avoid the later
breaking up of the king-side, but then White's queen knight
would be banned from e4, and White would be restricted to an
uncomfortable small amount of terrain.} Bb7 13.Ne4 Nbd7 {!
Black still does not fear the two bishops. After 14 Nxc5 Nxc5
his generally agressive position would outweigh the bishop
pair.} 14.Bd2 Rac8 {Leaving White's queen in a poor
position. As 15 Qb1 is not inviting, the following weakening
of Black's king-side is inevitable.} 15.Nxc5 Bxf3 16.gxf3 Rxc5
17.Qb3 Rg5+ 18.Kh1 {After this White's game soon becomes
untenable. Kf1 offered some defensive prospects.} Nc5 19.Qc2
{If 19 Bb4? Qb7! wins at once.} Rh5 20.Ba5 {Black threatened
to win with 20...Qc7 21 f4 Qb7+ 22 Kg1 Qf3. But the text is
likewise ineffectual.} Qb7 {This is decisive. If 21 e4 (or 21
Be4) Qb8 wins,If 21 Be2 Ng4 wins, and if 21 Kg2 Rg5+ winning.}
21.Rg1 Qxf3+ 22.Rg2 Nxd3 23.Qxd3 Ng4 24.Kg1 Nxf2 25.Rf1
{Blundering in a lost position. If 25 Rxf2 Rg5+ 26 Kf1 Qh1+
wins.} Qxg2+ 0-1
