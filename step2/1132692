1. d4 {Notes by Dr. Tarrasch} f5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 {The
Dutch game can scarcely be defended (compare the game Steinitz
v. Tarrasch). After Bb4 the Bishop is not in a good position,
and an exchange against the Knight is usually prejudicial to
Black. On e7, however, the Bishop has no future.} 4. e3 Nf6
5. Bd3 O-O 6. Ne2 d6 {To follow with e5. This move has this
disadvantage, that it cuts off the King's Bishop from the
King's side. Black does not perceive this in time.} 7. O-O e5
{At least Bxc3 should have been played before this.} 8. Nd5
Nxd5 9. cxd5 Nd7 {The exposed Bishop should retire to a5.}
10. Qa4 Qh4 11. Qxb4 Rf6 12. Ng3 Nc5 13. Rd1 Rh6 {White wins
the Bishop, and the game is of course decided. Black still
makes a desperate attack.} 14. h3 Ne4 15. dxe5 a5 16. Qd4 dxe5
17. Qxe5 Bd7 18. Bxe4 fxe4 19. Qxe4 Qf6 20. Qd4 Qf7 21. e4 Rg6
22. e5 Bb5 23. a4 Ba6 24. Ra3 Rd8 25. e6 Qe8 26. Nf5 c6
27. Rg3 {After Rxd5 there follows 28. Rxg6 Rxd4 29 Rxg7+ Kh8
30 Rxd4 and wins.} 1-0
