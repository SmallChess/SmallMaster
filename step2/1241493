1.d4 {Notes by J. R. Capablanca} d5 2.Nf3 e6 3.c4 Nf6 4.Bg5
Be7 5.e3 Nbd7 6.Nc3 O-O 7.Rc1 b6 8.cxd5 exd5 9.Bb5 {A new move
which has no merit outside of its novelty. I played it for the
first time against Teichmann in Berlin in 1913. The normal
move is Bd3, but Qa4 may the best, after all.} Bb7 10.Qa4 a6 {
c5 at once is the proper continuation.} 11.Bxd7 Nxd7 12.Bxe7
Qxe7 13.Qb3 { With the idea of preventing c5, but still better
would have been to castle.} Qd6 { Black could have played
c5. In the many complications arising from this move. I think,
Black would have come out all right.} 14.O-O Rfd8 15.Rfd1 Rab8
16.Ne1 { The object was to draw the Knight away from the line
of the Bishop, which would soon be open, as it actually
occurred in the game.} Nf6 17.Rc2 c5 18.dxc5 bxc5 19.Ne2 Ne4 {
All the attacks beginning either with Ng4 or d4 would have
failed.} 20.Qa3 Rbc8 21.Ng3 Nxg3 22.hxg3 Qb6 23.Rcd2 { Rdc1
would not have been better, because of the rejoinder d4, etc.}

Rd8 29.Qe2 Qd6 30.Kh2 Qd5 31.b3 Qf5 32.g4 Qg5 33.g3 Rd6 {
Unquestionably the best move; with any other move Black would,
perhaps, have found it impossible to draw.} 34.Kg2 g6 35.Qc4
Re6 36.Qxc5 Qxg4 37.f3 Qg5 38.Qxg5 hxg5 39.Kf2 Rd6 40.Ke3 Re6+
41.Kd4 Rd6+ 42.Ke3 { K-c5 was too risky. The way to win was
not at all clear and I even thought that with that move Black
might win.} Re6+ 43.Kf2 Rd6 44.g4 Rd1 45.Ke2 { Ke3 was the
right move. It was perhaps the only chance White had to win,
or at least come near it.} Ra1 46.Kd3 { Had the King been at
e3 he could go to d4, which would have gained a very important
move.} Kg7 47.b4 Rf1 { Best. Black, however, would have
accomplished nothing with this move, had the white King been
at d4.} 48.Ke3 { The remainder of the game needs no comments.}
