Nf8 15. h3 Ng6 {15...Qg5 at this point might be considered}
16. Qg3 Qg5 17. Qxg5 hxg5 {White's game is very sold. His
position is unassailable, while Black has two doubled pawns,
still the advance is not enough to win and with careful play
Black can easily draw.} 18. f3 f6 19. Kf2 Kf7 20. Nde2 a5 $1
21. b3 Reb8 $5 22. Nc1 Be6 23. Nd3 c5 24. Nb2 Ne5 {24...c4
would be to risky as White would play 25.Nxc4 Bxc4 26.bxc4 Rb4
27.Rd4 Ne5 28.Nd5 Rb2 29.Nxc7, and if instead of 28...Rb2,
28...Rxc4 then 29.Rxc4 Nxc4 30.Nxc7 Rb8 31.Re2 and White would
be a pawn to the good.} 25. Nd5 Rb7 26. Re3 Nc6 27. Rc3 $2 g6
{With this move Black starts an advance of the kingside pawns
which is ill-judged as it finally leaves White with a passed
pawn. He might have tried 27...Nb4 and if 28.a3 Nxd5 29.exd5
Bd7, and it seems as though Black could draw easily.} 28. a4
f5 $16 29. Ne3 Re8 30. Nec4 $16 Ra7 31. Re1 $1 Bxc4 $2
32. Nxc4 $1 Kf6 $1 $10 33. Ne3 Ne5 34. exf5 gxf5 35. g3 $16
35... Rh8 36. f4 gxf4 37. Nd5+ {The way White nurses the
advantage obtained through the advancing of Black's kingside
pawns is very instructive.} 37... Kf7 38. Nxf4 Rb7 {Since
White has a passed pawn on the kingside, Black tries to make a
break on the queenside, but this adventure nearly proved
fatal.} $1 39. Kg2 $15 39... c4 $1 40. bxc4 Rb4 41. c5 Rxa4
42. cxd6 cxd6 43. Rc7+ Kf6 $17 44. Nd5+ Kg5 {If 44...Ke6 45.c4
Re8 46.Ra7 and White would win the exchange.} 45. h4+ Kh6 {If
45...Kg6 46.Ne7+ Kf6 47.Rf1.} 46. Ne7 Rf8 47. Rd1 Rf7 {Black
is forced to give up the pawn. 47...Nc4 would not do, as White
would simply move 48.Kf2, threatening 49.Rd4 winning. Lasker
here gets out of a very tight place, on the face of it, it
looks as if White should win.} $2 48. Rxd6+ Kh7 49. Re6 Ng6 $1
50. Rxg6 Rxe7 51. Rgc6 Rxc7 52. Rxc7+ Kg6 53. Rc6+ Kf7 $18
54. Kf3 {Up to this point White has played the game well nigh
perfectly, but has Schechter really missed a chance here? The
situation is remarkable; Schechter plays the natural move, but
it only draws. I believe the best move 54.c3! and that if
there is a win, it must be through this move at this
point. The ending is worth studying. It is a most instructive
stuy on rook and pawn play.} 54... Re4 {A fine move. Lasker
shows his masterly hand. By sacrificing a second pawn he draws
the game.} 55. Rc5 $2 Kf6 56. Rxa5 Rc4 57. Ra6+ Ke5 58. Ra5+
Kf6 59. Ra6+ Ke5 60. Ra5+ Kf6 61. Ra2 Ke5 62. Rb2 Rc3+ 63. Kg2
Kf6 64. Kh3 Rc6 {To stop 65.Rb6+. 64...f4 would not do, on
account of 65.Rb3!} 65. Rb8 Rxc2 66. Rb6+ Kg7 67. h5 Rc4
68. h6+ Kh7 69. Rf6 Ra4 1/2-1/2
