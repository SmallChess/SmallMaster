1.e4 {Notes by Frank Marshall} e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.b4 Bb6
{Declining the gambit. This is supposed to be better for Black
than the acceptance. However, White gets dangerous attacks in
both branches} 5.c3 {To support d4, but to slow. 5 O-O is
stronger. Another good suggestion by Ulvestad is 5 a4 followed
by Ba3.} d6 6.O-O Bg4 7.d4 exd4 8.Bxf7+ {?} Kf8 {? Black
should have accepted. The sacrifice is unsound.} 9.Bd5 Nge7
{9...Nf6 is better as after 10 h3 Black could play 10...Bxf3
without the dangerous recapture by the White queen with a
check. The text move enables White to finish with a killing
attack.} 10.h3 Bh5 11.g4 Bg6 12.Ng5 {!} Qd7 13.Ne6+ Ke8
14.Nxg7+ Kf8 15.Be6 Qd8 16.Bh6 Bxe4 17.Nh5+ Ke8 18.Nf6# 1-0
