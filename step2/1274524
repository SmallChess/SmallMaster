1. d4 {Notes by Gunsberg} d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bf4 {I
consider this move of doubtful value.} 4... Be7 5. e3 O-O
6. Nf3 b6 7. Bd3 c5 8. dxc5 bxc5 9. O-O Nc6 10. cxd5 { We
quite approve of this exchange of pawns, though with the
Bishop on f4 it is not quite as effective as with the bishop
on b2.} 10... exd5 11. Rc1 Be6 12. Ne2 Qb6 13. Ne5 {A clever
way of defending the b-pawn.} 13... Nxe5 14. Bxe5 Ng4 15. Bc3
Qd6 16. g3 Bd7 17. Nf4 Qh6 {Black has obtained a promising
attack, but he is placed that unless he succeeds with it he
will suffer a loss on the Queenside.} 18. h3 Nf6 19. Bxf6 Bxf6
20. Nxd5 {A bold course and showing that White must have seen
a long way ahead and satisfied himself as to his future
safety.} 20... Bxh3 21. Nxf6+ Qxf6 22. Qh5 {A fine move, and
the key to the whole combination which has evidently taken
Black by surprise.} 22... Qh6 23. Qxh6 gxh6 24. Rfd1 Rac8
25. Rc3 Rfd8 26. Rdc1 Rc6 27. Be4 Ra6 28. Rxc5 Rxa2 29. Rb5
{This move not only protects the pawn, but also enables White
to make better use of his Rooks.} 29... Be6 {Black might have
been first in the field by playing 29... Rd2. If he was afraid
of 30. Rh5 he ought to have adopted different play on his 27th
move.} 30. Rc7 a5 31. Bf5 Ra1+ 32. Kg2 Ba2 {Curiously this was
the only square available for the bishop. Worse was 32... Bxf5
33. Rxf5 Rf8 34. Ra7 a4 35. Rf4 Ra2 36. Rb4.} 33. b3 {Again
cleverly played. White could not have taken the a-pawn as
Black would have replied 33. ... Bd5+ the text was played to
cut out the bishop} 33... a4 {This is best as 33... Ra8 would
have been answered by 34. Be4 followed by 35.Bd5. Black, by
giving up the pawn, liberates his Bishop and plans a very
ingenious counter-combination.} 34. bxa4 Rd2 35. a5 h5 { An
important factor in Black's plan directed against the White
King} 36. a6 Bd5+ 37. e4 Raa2 {Black's carefully prepared plan
has now matured} 38. Kf3 { A courageous reply, and the only
move to win the game. If either 38. exd5 or 38. Rxd5 Black
will obtain a draw by perpetual check.} 38... Ra3+ 39. Kf4
Rxf2+ 40. Ke5 Bxe4 41. Bxe4 Rxa6 42. Kd4 Rh6 {Black's object
is, if possible, to play ...h4} 43. Ke3 Rf1 44. Ke2 Rff6 {It
seems necessary to keep the Rook on this file, as otherwise
White plays 45. Rg5+ followed by 46.Bd5. But it admits of
White pursuing his advantage even more forcibly in a different
way.} 45. Rc8+ Kg7 46. Rg5+ Rhg6 47. Bxg6 hxg6 48. Rgc5 Re6+
49. Kf3 Rf6+ 50. Kg2 Rd6 51. R8c7 Rd2+ 52. Kh3 Rd6 53. R5c6
Rd5 54. Rc2 Rf5 55. Kg2 g5 56. Rf2 Rxf2+ 57. Kxf2 Kg6 58. Kf3
