1.Nf3 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.g3 d5 4.d4 {!? A rare move, which Illescas
brought to my attention. While analyzing this system for
Black, I noted that it was not easy for him to equalize; so I
started looking at it from White's perspective, especially
since this amounts to a sort of "anti-Gruenfeld". Chess has
begun to consist more and more of forced sequences. And the
Gruenfeld is a good opening to use whenever you really want to
slam out a draw without giving your White opponent the chance
to get even into the middlegame. This is one reason the
Gruenfeld is so popular today. Although in this tournament,
even such dyed-in-the-wool "Gruenfelders" as Shirov and Leko
(who never play anything else) avoided this defense against me
- presumably, because they thought I would be
well-prepared. But for this game, I myself wanted to avoid the
Gruenfeld. This is a position I have played many times, with
knights on c3 and c6. Without the knights, this version is not
quite as good for White, but it's an interesting move,
nonetheless. -- Kramnik }dxc4 5.Qa4+ Bd7 6.Qxc4 Bc6 7.dxc5 Bd5
