5.c4 Nf6 6.Be3 e6 7.Qb3 b6 8.Ne5 c6 {Black treats the opening
in a novel manner; but these pawn moves weaken his queenside.}

{I fail to see the object of this move; Black is entirely on
the defensive and cannot undertake anything.}20.Rfe1 Bxg3

Ngh7 {Of course ...Nxf3+ then White would get an attack on the
h-file.} 27.b4 axb4 28.axb4 Qd6 29.c5 Qc7 30.Na4 b5 31.Nb6 Rb8
32.Qf4 {White is playing very well and with this move brings
the queen into action. Black dare not exchange queens because
after qxf4 33 gxf4 Nd5 34 Bxd5 exd5 35 Re7 White would have an
easily won endgame.} Qb7 33.g4 Nd7 34.Nxd7 Qxd7 35.g3 f6 {One
of Mr. Tinsley's wily traps.} 36.Qe4 {It is unaccountable that
such an ingenious player as Mr. Janowski should have not seen
Black's design. Bg2 was his move now, and there can be no
doubt that the weakness of all the Black pawns would have led
to loss of material sooner or later.} Ng5 37.Qxc6 {Losing a
piece and the game. the rest is silence.} Rbc8 38.Qxd7 Nxf3+
