1.d4 {Notes by Geza Maroczy} Nf6 2.Nf3 e6 3.Bg5 c5 4.Bxf6
{This exchange is not to be recommended, but Wahltuch is not
fond of the well-known paths and treats the openings in a very
original manner.} Qxf6 5.e4 cxd4 6.Qxd4 Nc6 7.Qxf6 gxf6 8.c3
b6 9.Nbd2 Bb7 10.Bd3 Rc8 11.Nc4 {The knight is not well placed
on c4; O-O was to be considered, the strength of the Black
bishops makes itself gradually felt.} Rg8 12.g3 Nd8 13.Ke2 h6
14.Rhe1 {This is a mistake; it is interesting to notice how
Capablanca was waiting for this blunder; White's position
after Ne3 would not be so bad.} Bxe4 15.Bxe4 Rxc4 16.Kd3 Rc7
17.Nd4 a6 18.f4 Bc5 19.Nc2 d5 {The finishing touch, White is
without hope of saving the game.} 20.Bf3 f5 21.a3 Be7 22.Nb4
a5 23.Nc2 Nb7 24.Nd4 Nc5+ 25.Kc2 Ne4 {The knight rules the
situation.} 26.Rad1 Bf6 27.Nb5 Rc5 28.a4 Ke7 29.Bxe4 fxe4
30.Re3 h5 31.h3 Bh8 32.Kb3 f5 33.Nd4 Bxd4 34.Rxd4 h4 {The
champion of the world terminates the game with a few powerful
moves; the manner in which he rolls up the pawns and gets two
united passed pawns is very instructive.} 35.gxh4 e5 36.fxe5
f4 37.Re1 Ke6 38.c4 Kxe5 39.Rxd5+ Rxd5 40.cxd5 f3 0-1
