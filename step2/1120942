1. e4 {Notes by H. N. Pillsbury} c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4
4. Nxd4 g6 5. Nxc6 {Although this line of play has been
adopted by Lasker himself with considerable success, it is
probably premature, owing to the strengthening of Black's
center pawns. 5 Be3 is more usual and more correct.} bxc6 {In
an exhibition game played in New York, Lasker, as second
player, retook here with the queen's pawn, allowing the
exchange of queens, and relied upon his end game ability to
outplay his opponent, and was successful. It is not, however,
as good as the text.} 6. Qd4 f6 7. Bc4 e6 8. O-O Nh6 9. Nc3
Nf7 10. Be3 Bg7 11. Rad1 O-O 12. Qd2 f5 13. exf5 {This still
more strengthens Black's already formidable center. Probably
best now was 13 f3 d5 14 exd5 cxd5 15 Bb3 Ba6 16 Rfe1
retaining a pressure on the center pawns.} gxf5 14. Bd4
{Premature at least. 14 f4 d5 15 Be2 threatening Rf3-g3 was
far superior.} d5 15. Bxg7 Kxg7 16. Be2 e5 17. Na4 Qf6 18. Nc5
f4 19. f3 Bf5 20. Bd3 Rae8 21. Rde1 Re7 22. Rf2 Nd6 23. Qc3
Bg6 24. Rfe2 Rfe8 25. Bxg6 hxg6 26. Nd3 Nc4 27. Nf2 Ne3
28. Nd1 d4 29. Qd3 e4 30. fxe4 Rxe4 31. Nxe3 fxe3 32. Rf1 Rf4
33. Rxf4 Qxf4 {Black has managed his center attack in capital
style, and obtained a theoretical winning position. White is
unable to stir, and although the game lasts for some time, the
issue can hardly be doubtful.} 34. Qd1 c5 35. b3 a5 36. Qe1 a4
37. Qa5 Rf8 38. Qe1 Rf5 39. Qd1 Kf6 40. Qe1 Ke6 41. Qd1 Kd5
42. h3 {This hastens the end, as Black, after judiciosly
retreating the king to avoid danger of perpetual check arising
from Qd3, etc., is enabled to put his queen on g3 and then the
game is over.} Qe4 43. Qe1 Qf4 44. Qd1 Ke5 45. Qe1 Kf6 46. Qd1
Kg7 47. Qe1 Rf6 48. Qd1 Qg3 49. Qd3 Rf2 50. Qe4 {An ingenious
attempt to draw by perpetual check if Black took the rook.}
Qf4 51. Qe7+ Kh6 {For if Re1 Black wins by either ...Rxg2+ and
...Qf2+ or by the simpler ...e2.} 0-1
