1.e4 {Annotations by Semion Alapin} e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6
4.Ba4 d6 5.c4 {An interesting novelty, which probably deserves
attention. At least it stops Black's ...b7-b5} Bd7 {Best for
Black is 5...Bg4 6.Nc3 Nf6 7.d3 Be7 8.Nd5 etc.} 6.d4 g6 7.dxe5
Nxe5 8.Nxe5 dxe5 9.O-O Bg7 10.Nc3 Ne7 11.Be3 c6 12.Qe2 Qc7
13.Rfd1 Rd8 14.Bc5 Nc8 15.Rac1 f6 {If 15...Be6 16.Nd5!.} 16.b4
Kf7 17.Bb3 Be6 18.a3 Rxd1+ 19.Nxd1 Rd8 20.Nb2 Bh6 21.Be3 Bf8
22.Nd3 b6 23.f4 {In this position, Black, who was in time
trouble, played 23...Qd7?, and White answered with 24.Rd1,
which wins at least a pawn. Then unexpectedly Dr. Tarrasch
took his move back, and replaced it with a bigger mistake.}
Bd6 {??} 24.f5 {!} 1-0
