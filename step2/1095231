1.d4 {Notes by Frank Marshall} e6 2.c4 Nf6 3.Nf3 d5 4.Nc3 c6
5.Bg5 Nbd7 6.cxd5 exd5 7.e3 Be7 {After some transpositions,
the game has now become identical with my Moscow encounter
with Rubinstein. The two games continue the same right up to
White's 18th move!} 8.Bd3 O-O 9.Qc2 Re8 10.O-O Nf8 11.Rae1
{According to the authorities, c1 is the proper square, but as
I am interested in forcing e4, i prefer the text.} Ne4 12.Bxe7
Qxe7 13.Bxe4 dxe4 14.Nd2 f5 15.f3 exf3 16.Nxf3 Be6 17.e4 fxe4
18.Nxe4 {At last a deviation from the Rubinstein game! There I
played 18 Rxe4.} Qb4 {If 18...Bf5 19 Qb3+ and if 19...Qe6 20
Nd6 Qxb3 21 axb3 Rxe1 22 Rxe1 with advantage to White.} 19.a3
Bb3 20.Qf2 Qb6 21.Ne5 Rad8 22.Nc5 {Black has hopes of
concentrating on the d-pawn, however, White's superior
mobility and attacking prospects seem to outweigh that
possibility.} Bd5 23.Re3 Qc7 24.Qc2 b6 25.Ne4 Bxe4 {After the
removal of this valuable piece, Black's position is bound to
fall apart quickly, ...h6 should have been tried.} 26.Rxe4
Rxd4 27.Rxd4 {Desperation. He has no good moves in view of the
threatened Rf7 or Qb3+.} Qxe5 28.Qf2 Qe3 {? But this looses at
once ...Qe6 would have prolonged the game.} 29.Qxe3 Rxe3
30.Rd8 1-0
