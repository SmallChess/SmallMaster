1.d4 {Notes by I. Gunsberg} d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bf4 {May we
reiterate the fact that we look upon the Bishop’s move with
indifference?} Be7 5.e3 O-O 6.Nf3 c5 {Circumstances alter
cases. There is no reason why Black should rush on voluntarily
to isolate his Pawn. He might play b6 first, and we also think
that when White has played Bf4 some of the objections against
the move of c6 fall away, as a premium, so to speak, is placed
on Black’s chance of playing e5 which, of course, is only
possible in connection with c6.} 7.dxc5 Bxc5 {dxc4 for Black
does not look wholesome, though perhaps with careful play not
much harm would result : e.g. dxc4 ; 8 Bd6 Ne8 9 Bxe7 Qxe7 10
Qd4, etc.} 8.cxd5 exd5 9.Bd3 Nc6 10.O-O Bg4 11.Rc1 d4 {Bb6 was
requisite.} 12.Nb5 {A very effective move, which could not be
met by Qb6, on account of Bc7.} Bb6 13.Nbxd4 Nxd4 14.exd4 Qd5
{Bxd4 would not do, on account of White’s reply, Bxh7+. If,
however, Black had played Bxf3 15 Qxf3 Qxd4, White would be
likely to get up a harassing attack with his Queen’s Bishop
and Rook somewhat as follows: 16 Rc4 Qxb2 17 Bxg5 Bd8 18 Rh4,
and so on. If in this variation Black on the fourteenth move,
instead of Qxd4, played Bxd4, he will likewise subject himself
to the harassing action of the two Bishops, beginning with
White’s i6 Bg5.} 15.Be5 Rac8 16.Qe2 Bxd4 17.Bxd4 Bxf3 18.Qxf3
Rxc1 19.Rxc1 Qxd4 20.Rc3 Rd8 {Black has managed matters
cleverly so far, having got rid of White’s Bishops. Rd8 is
also a clever move, for if White plays Qxb7P, Black replies
Ne4.} 21.h3 Qb4 22.Rc2 Qe1+ 23.Kh2 Qe5+ 24.g3 g6 25.Bc4 Rd7
26.Re2 Qd4 27.Rc2 Kg7 28.Bf1 Rd5 29.Bg2 Rc5 {If Rf5, White
plays 30 Qe3, though there would be no harm either in 30 Qxb7,
or Qe2.} 30.Qe2 b6 31.Rd2 Re5 32.Qd1 Qb4 33.a3 Qe7 34.Qc2 h5
35.Bf3 Rc5 36.Qd3 h4 {A praiseworthy attempt to infuse some
life into the game. If White had taken the Pawn Black did not
stand to lose the draw, but he might possibly have obtained
attacking chances.} 37.Kg2 Rg5 38.Qd4 hxg3 39.fxg3 Qe1 40.Rf2
Re5 41.Be2 Qa5 42.Bc4 Rf5 43.Re2 Qc5 44.Qxc5 Rxc5 45.Bb3 Kf8
46.g4 g5 47.Kg3 Rc7 48.h4 {The game is gradually drifting
towards the inevitable draw, though the conduct of play has
been careful and sound on both sides. If White plays 48 Re5
Re7 49 Rf5 Re3+, etc.} gxh4 49.Kxh4 Re7 50.Rxe7 Kxe7 51.Kg5
