1. Nf3 {Notes by Peter Clarke} e6 {There are people who play
this against any opening move by White. Perhaps it is the only
reply that unquestionably deserves such a strange
distinction.} 2. g3 f5 3. Bg2 Nf6 4. O-O Be7 5. d4 O-O 6. c4
c6 {He intens to adapt the stonewall formation and decides on
this order of moves to avoid the possibility of his
black-squared Bishop being exchanged by b3 and Ba3 (this way
he has ...d6 in reserve); not that there is anything really to
be feared in that.} 7. Qc2 Qe8 {The manouver ...Q-e8-g6 (or
h5) is the normal method of preparing the K-side attack. Here
he starts it while waiting for White to reveal his hand more.}
8. Nbd2 d5 9. Ne5 {Petrosian is employing the same strategy as
he did against Pirtskhalava-placing his Knights on d3 and f3
in order to exploit the hole on e5. What is interesting is
that he has found an entirely different route for them to
take.} Nbd7 10. Nd3 Ne4 11. Nf3 {White has avoided relieving
Black's game by exchanges and is now ready to begin the drive
forward in the center. This is a critical moment for the
second player, for he must seek counter-play on the K side and
yet not overreach himself there; 11...Qh5 seems
natural. Instead Bondarevsky tries to combat White's plans by
striking out first on the other wing, a policy as wrong as it
is anti-thematic.} Nd6 12. b3 b5 13. c5 {!} Nf7 14. a4 {The
new extension to the wall must fall, after which Black is left
with a weakened and exposed Q side, not at all what he had
bargained for.} bxa4 15. Rxa4 Bf6 16. Bb2 a6 {For the one and
only time he could have played ...e5 here. Although it would
have greatly freed his pieces-after, for instance, 17.dxe5
Nfxe5 18.Rfa1 Nxd3 19.exd3 Bxb2 20.Qxb2 Nxc5 21.Rxa7-White's
too would have had the board opened up for them. And open
positions invariably favor the side with the initiative.}
17. Nfe5 Nfxe5 18. dxe5 Be7 19. f4 Rb8 {If 19...g5 20.fxg5
Bxg5 21.Bc1! Black's problem is to find a constructive plan
which does not help his opponent.} 20. Rfa1 Rb5 21. b4 {!
21.Bd4 was superficially correct, but White would like to see
his Knight on d4; moreover, he wishes to preserve the
possibility of Bc1, as mentioned in the previous note.} h5
{Bondarevsky has not yet had all the fight squeezed out of
him.! He is aiming to win some space on the K side and so
perhaps put White out of his methodical stride.} 22. Bc3 h4
23. e3 Nb8 {Unfortunately this passive step is necessary, as
White is threatening to bring his KB to bear on the a-pawn.}
24. Ne1 Rb7 {Better was the prelimanary 24...hxg3. As played,
Black loses the benefit he expected from the advance of the
h-pawn.} 25. gxh4 Bxh4 26. Nf3 Bd8 27. h4 {! It is clear that
Black's last chance of doing anything active- ...g5-has
gone. The outlook is one of grim defence behind his pawn
barrier.} Qh5 28. Be1 Bd7 29. Qf2 Kf7 {? A final error,
shortening the game by many moves. He had to return his Bishop
to c8 to protect his a-pawn, in which event it still would
have required a long campaign of White to breach the defences
(the g-file is the weak spot). As soon as the pawn is removed,
there is nothing to hold the attacker off.} 30. Bf1 Rh8
31. Bxa6 Nxa6 32. Rxa6 Be7 33. Ra7 Rhb8 {He attacked the enemy
h-pawn in vain and now he has had to give up. The end is not
far away.} 34. Rxb7 Rxb7 35. Nd4 Qh8 36. Qg3 Qb8 {Black was
almost in Zugzwang; for instance, Bishop moves permit Ra8,
whilst the threat of b5 continually hangs over him.} 37. h5
Ra7 38. Rc1 {Avoiding a subtle trap-38.Rxa7 Qxa7 39.Qg6+ Kf8
40.Ne6+ Bxe6 41.Qxe6 Qa1! 42.Qc8+ Kf7 48.Qxf5+ Kg8, and White
must either give perpetual check or lose his Bishop.} Qg8
39. Qg6+ Kf8 40. b5 {This inevitable breakthrough is the
stronger for being delayed. If 40...cxb5, then 41.c6 Bc 8
42.Nxb5 and 43.Nd6 wins.} Qf7 41. bxc6 Bc8 {Black sealed this
move and the next day, in view of the continuation 42.Qxf7+
Kxf7 43.Nb5 Ra8 44.Nd6+ Kf8 45.c7, he resigned.} 1-0
