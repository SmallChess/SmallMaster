1. e4 {Notes by G. Kasparov from the book: "The Test Of
Time".} c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 g6 5. c4 Bg7 6. Be3
d6 7. Nc3 Nh6 8. Be2 O-O 9. Qd2 {In my opinion, another
promising development plan is 9 O-O f5 10 Qd2 Ng4 11 Bxg4
fxg4.} Ng4 10. Bxg4 Bxg4 11. O-O Qa5 12. Rac1 Rac8 13. b3 a6
14. Nxc6 Rxc6 {14...bxc6 is unfavourable because of 15. c5!}
15. Bh6 Rfc8 {But not 15...Bh8? which leads to: 16 Nd5 Qd8 17
Qg5! or15...b5? 16 Bxg7 Kxg7 17 Qg5!} 16. Bxg7 Kxg7 17. f4
{!?-In spite of the exchanges, the position has not lost its
sharpness. After 17 Qb2! f6 18 Nd5 White evidently stands a
little better, but I was in too much hurry and the evaluation
immediately changed.} f6 {!-Now the gains resulting from the
advance of the f- pawn is unclear, whereas the threat of ...b5
is unpleasant. White decides to complicate the play at the
cost of his c-pawn.} 18. Kh1 b5 19. f5 g5 {The incautious
capture 19...bxc4 would have lost a piece - 20 b4! Qxb4 21
h3.} 20. Qf2 {If 20 Qb2 bxc4 21 b4 then 21... Qe5!} bxc4
21. Nd5 cxb3 22. Rxc6 Rxc6 23. Qa7 {White planned this raid
before the 18th move. Now the knight is in the centre and the
queen rampaging in the enemy rear compensate by their activity
for the lost material.} Qd8 24. axb3 Be2 {!} 25. Re1 Bb5
26. h4 {Of course, 26. Qxe7 would have favored black but now I
considered that 26... h6 with the possible sequel 27 Rd1 Kf8
28 Kh2 Rc2 29 e5! Qd7! (29... dxe5? 30 Nf4!) 30 Qxd7 Bxd7 31
exf6 was the most solid and would give equal chances. Not
wishing to tempt fate against an opponent who before this had
won six games in a row, I offered a draw, but he declined.}
gxh4 {?- This reply weakens the kings position and gives the
white rook a clear objective.} 27. Qf2 Kh8 28. Qxh4 Rc2 {Black
has got rid of the threats to his e7-pawn and has activated
his rook, but he stands worse in view of the impending danger
to his king.} 29. Re3 {A natural manoeuvre, but at the same
time a mistake, which loses White his advantage. After 29 Nf4!
Black would have been unable to transfer his queen to f8 and
Bishop to f7 and would evidently have lost, e.g. 29... Be8 30
Ne6 Qa5 31 Qg3, or 29... Qe8 30 Re3 Qf7 31 Rg3.} Qf8 {!}
30. Rh3 Qg7 31. Rg3 Qf8 32. Nf4 Be8 {!-Now black's defenses
hold. After 33. Ng6+ Bxg6 34 fxg6 Qg7 he has everything in
order.} 33. Ne6 Qf7 34. Kg1 {Had he caught the queen by 34
Rg7, white would have risked losing. Realizing that my
advantage had gone, I set a last trap.} Qh5 {After 34... Bd7
35 Nd8 Qf8 the game would have immediately been decided by 36
Qh6!, but by now black is firmly on the correct path.}
35. Qxh5 Bxh5 36. Rg7 Re2 {!- The draw becomes obvious,
whereas after 36... Rc7? 37 g4! White would have unexpectedly
have trapped the bishop.} 37. Rxe7 {White too is on the alert:
37 g4? Rxe4! 38 gxh5 Rxe6 39 h6 Re5 40 Rf7 Kg8 41 Rg7+ Kf8 42
Rxh7 Rxf5 43 Rh3+ Kf7 44 h7 Rh5! and black wins.} Rxe4 38. Ra7
h6 39. Ra8+ Kh7 40. Ra7+ 1/2-1/2
