1.d4 {Notes by Blackburne} d5 2.e3 Nf6 3.Nf3 e6 4.Be2 Bd6
5.O-O O-O 6.c4 c6 {This move, in all openings on the queen's
side, was condemned by the old masters, but is frequently
adopted by many players of the present day. The object of the
move is to break up the center later on by e5.} 7.c5
{Premature. Nc3 or Qb3 was the correct play.} Bc7 8.b4 a5 9.b5
cxb5 10.Bxb5 Nc6 11.Nc3 Bd7 12.Qb3 {Rb1 is stronger.} Re8
13.Bb2 {Again a weak move. Ba3 or Na4 and White's game is all
right.} Rb8 14.Rab1 Qe7 15.a3 b6 16.Qa4 Rec8 17.Kh1 {Of course
White could not win the knight on account of Bxh2+ winning the
queen but g3 would have been stronger than the move made.} Qe8
18.cxb6 Rxb6 19.Bxc6 Bxc6 20.Qc2 {White's game is now very
bad.} Bd6 21.Nd2 Bd7 22.Rfc1 Qe7 23.Ra1 Rcb8 {This is
necessary before playing ...Ng4 for suppose 23...Ng4 24 Nxd5
exd5 25 Qxc8+ Bxc8 26 Rxc8+ and White wins a pawn.} 24.Ra2 Ng4
25.Nf3 Bxh2 26.Nd1 Qf6 27.Nxh2 Qh4 28.Qc7 e5 {Black finishes
the game in fine style.} 29.Kg1 Qxh2+ 0-1
