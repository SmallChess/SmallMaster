1.d4 {Notes by J.R. Capablanca} d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Be7
5.e3 O-O 6.Nf3 Nbd7 7.Qc2 c6 {c5 is the proper move.} 8.Bd3
{Castles on the Queen's side would have been a much more
energetic way of continuing, but probably White did not want
to take the risk of exposing himself to a Queen's side attack,
having then his King on that side of the board.} dxc4 9.Bxc4
Nd5 10.Bxe7 Qxe7 11.O-O Nxc3 12.bxc3 b6 13.Bd3 g6 14.a4 Bb7
15.a5 c5 16.Nd2 { This may not have been White's best
move. Yet it is extremely difficult to point out anything
better.} e5 {Probably the only move to save the game. It was
essential to break up White’s center and to create a weakness
in White's game that would compensate Black for his own
weakness on the Queen's side of the board.} 17.Be4 Bxe4
18.Qxe4 Rae8 19.axb6 axb6 20.Ra7 exd4 21.Qc6 {Qxe7 was
slightly better, but Black had, in that case, an adequate
defense.} Rd8 22.cxd4 cxd4 23.exd4 {Not 23.Ne4, because of
Nb8!} Qf6 24.Qxf6 Nxf6 25.Nf3 Nd5 26.Rb1 f6 27.Kf1 Rf7 28.Rba1
Rdd7 29.Rxd7 Rxd7 30.g3 {There was no reasonable motive to
continue such a game, as there was not very much to be done by
either player.} 1/2-1/2
