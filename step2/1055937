1.d4 {Notes by J. Lowenthal. Herr Harrwitz, when first player,
almost invariably adopts this mode of opening the game. It is
one with every variation of which he is thoroughly familiar,
and in no match of importance has he ever failed of using it.}
e6 2.c4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bf4 {Mr. Morphy agrees with us in the
opinion, that at this stage the text move is the most forcible
one that can be selected ; indeed, he says he found it so
strong. that in his after games with Harrwitz he proferred
meeting d4 with f5, in place of exposing himself to this
attack.} a6 5.e3 c5 6.Nf3 Nc6 7.a3 cxd4 8.exd4 dxc4 9.Bxc4 b5
10.Bd3 Bb7 11.O-O Be7 12.Be5 O-O 13.Qe2 Nd5 14.Bg3 {Very well
played for it not only obviates the capture of the Bishop and
the subsequent posting of the King's Knight at f4, but also
prevents the advance of the f-pawn.} Kh8 { Mr. Morphy
considers that he lost the game by this move, and that if he
had played Bf6 instead, the game would have been even.}
15.Rfe1 Bf6 { The following variation will show that Black
could not have thrown up the f-pawn as he had intended,
15...f5 16 Qxe6 Nxc3 17 bxc3 f4 18 Qe4 g6 19 Bxf4 with a won
game.} 16.Qe4 g6 17.Nxd5 Qxd5 18.Qxd5 exd5 19.Ne5 Rad8 20.Nxc6
Bxc6 21.Rac1 Rc8 22.Bd6 Rg8 23.Be5 Kg7 {It is a singular fact,
that in the earlier stages of every contest upon which
Mr. Murphy has entered, he has played very much below his real
force. This game presents none of those brilliant moves and
remarkable combinations that so eminently abound in his
general play, and at this point be selects a move which
actually gives the victory to his opponent. The Bishop should
have now been captured, and the game thereby would have been
rendered an even one.} 24.f4 Bd7 25.Kf2 h6 26.Ke3 Rxc1 27.Rxc1
Rc8 28.Rc5 Bxe5 29.fxe5 Be6 { If Black had exchanged Rooks,
with the view of breaking up his adversary's centre Pawns, the
White King would have been posted at d4, and victory secured.}
