1.d4 {Notes by Blackburne} d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Be7
5.Nf3 O-O 6.Rc1 {Perhaps it is better to play the King's Pawn
before this move.} dxc4 7.e3 {e4 could also be played, and
would have led to a more open game.} c5 8.Bxc4 cxd4 9.exd4 Nc6
10.O-O Qa5 {Qb6 is more attacking and appears stronger.}
11.Bf4 {This Bishop ought to have retired to e3 at once.} Rd8
12.Nb5 Ne8 13.Be3 a6 14.Nc3 Nf6 {Bf6, bringing one more Piece
to bear on the weak Queen's Pawn, would have given Black a
good game.} 15.Qe2 b5 16.Bb3 Bb7 17.Rfd1 Nb4 18.Ne5 Rac8 19.a3
Nbd5 20.Nxd5 Nxd5 21.Rxc8 Rxc8 22.Qh5 g6 23.Qf3 f5 {This
loses; f6 might probably have saved the game.} 24.Qg3 Kg7
25.h4 Qd8 {An unaccountable blunder; the game, however, could
not be saved.} 26.Bh6+ Kg8 27.Nxg6 Bf6 28.Ne5 1-0
