1. e4 { Notes by Chigorin. A certain Mr. Janowski, a young
Russian amateur, has made his appearance at the Cafe de la
Regence and defeated many of the regular players there. From
this game against Goetz, my readers will see that his style is
most appealing. The play is quite lively in character although
not entirely solid on Janowski's part.} 1...e5 2. Nf3 Nc6
3. d4 exd4 4. c3 {White’s pawn sacrifice in this situation
ought not to achieve its main aim – an attack. By continuing
4...dxc3 5 Bc4 Nf6 6 Nxc3 Bb4 7 O-O O-O, Black retains his
extra pawn in a quiet position} 4...Bc5 5. Bc4 Nf6 {The game
has now transposed into a well-known variation of the Giuoco
Piano (1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 Bc4 Bc5 4 c3 Nf6 5 d4 exd4 etc.).}
6. cxd4 Bb4+ 7. Bd2 Bxd2+ 8. Nbxd2 d5 9. exd5 Nxd5 10. O-O {10
Qb3 is rightly considered best; White wants to force Black to
defend his knight with Nc6-e7. An inferior reply would be
10...Na5 11 Qa4+ c6 12 Bxd5 Qxd5 13 O-O O-O 14 Rac1 Qb5 15 Qa3
b6 16 Qc3 Bd7 17 Ne5 Rad8 18 Ndf3 (White needs to defend his
own d-pawn before he can threaten the black c-pawn), and if
now 18...f6, White continues 19 Nxd7 Rxd7 20 b4 etc. }
10...O-O 11. Re1 {Now 11 Qb3 would be met by 11...Na5 and
Na5xc4.} 11...Nf4 12. Ne4 Ne7 {Black is manoeuvring aimlessly
with his knights. Once the other one has gone to f4, it would
be more logical to follow with 12...Be6. Then if White
exchanges bishops, opening the f-file for Black, the knight on
f4 will be very strongly placed -- for example 13 Bxe6 fxe6 14
Nc5 Qd5 15 Nxb7 Rab8 16 Nc5 Rxb2, etc. Black was evidently
afraid of having an isolated pawn; he failed to assess the
benefits that his position would acquire at the same time.}
13. Qd2 Neg6 14. h3 Nd5 {? Here too, 14...Be6 or 14...c6 would
have been better.} 15. Rac1 c6 16. Bxd5 Qxd5 17. Rc5 {By
giving up his a-pawn White obtains a kingside attack, but with
faultless defence Black could have repelled it and retained
his extra material. } 17...Qxa2 18. Rh5 f6 {The best move. On
18...h6 White plays 19 Rxh6! gxh6 20 Qxh6 and should win, as
Black can't parry the threats of Ne4-f6 mate or Ne4-g5 without
giving up his knight.} 19. Nd6 b6 {Probably aimed at
preventing Rh5-a5. At this point Black had the chance to
repulse the attack by 19...Rd8. If White replies 20 Ra5 Qb3 21
Re3 Qb6 22 Nc4, it's clear that after 22...Qc7 his attack is
at an end. To sustain it, he would therefore have to defend
the knight from b4 with his queen. An interesting point is
that after 20 Qb4 a5 Black wins the knight but loses the game:
21 Qc5 Nf4 22 Rh4 Ne6 23 Qh5 Rxd6 24 Qxh7+ Kf7 25 Rg4 Bd7 26
Nh4, and on 26...Rg8 White has 27 Nf5, threatening Nf5-h6+
etc. So after 19...Rd8 20 Qb4 Black ought to play 20...Nf4 21
Ra5 Nd5! 22 Qd2 Qb3, and White's attack is beaten off. }
20. Qc2 {! A powerful move. By threatening to take the pawn on
c6 and immobilizing the knight on g6, White gains time to
occupy the seventh rank with a rook. Janowski conducts the
final attack with unerring skill. } 20...Bd7 21. Re7 Rad8
22. Nh4 Be8 23. Nhf5 Bf7 24. d5 {!} Nf4 {On 24..cxd5, White
has 25 Nxf7 Rxf7 26 Rxf7 Kxf7 27 Qc7+ and wins.} 25. Nxf7 Rxf7
{If 25...Nxh5, then 26 N5h6+ and mate in two more moves.}
26. Rxf7 Nxh5 27. Nh6+ Kh8 28. dxc6 Qd5 29. c7 Rc8 30. Rf8+
Rxf8 31. c8=Q 1-0
