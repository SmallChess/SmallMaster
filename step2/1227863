1. e4 {Notes by Dr. Tarrasch} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. b4
Bb6 {It is noteworthy that Lasker usually declines the Evans’
Gambit, although he has declared that he knows a winning
defence.} 5. c3 d6 6. a4 a6 7. a5 Ba7 8. b5 axb5 9. Bxb5 Nf6 {
Ne7 seems preferable.} 10. a6 {Instead of developing, White
makes premature attempts at attack, which finally only
facilitate and hasten the development of his opponent.} O-O
{Nxe4 would be bad on account of 11 Qa4 Nc5 12 axb7.} 11. d3
Ne7 12. axb7 Bxb7 13. Na3 {Bxf2+ was threatened.} d5 {Black is
so far advanced in development that he can at once begin the
attack.} 14. O-O Ng6 15. exd5 Nxd5 16. Qe1 {All of White’s
Pieces are in bad positions, with the exception of the King’s
Knight f3. White’s game is thus no longer capable even of
defence.} Qf6 17. Bg5 { With this and the mistake immediately
following the Bishop gets also exposed. It would have been
better to interrupt the file of the adverse Queen’s Bishop
with Ng5 and e4.} Qf5 18. Nc2 {?} Nxc3 19. Rxa7 {He may well
despair.} Bxf3 20. Ne3 {After Be3, Qg4 wins.} Qxg5 21. Rxa8
Rxa8 22. Qxc3 Nf4 23. Ra1 Ne2+ 0-1
