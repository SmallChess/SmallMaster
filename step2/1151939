1.e4 {Notes by Emanuel Lasker} e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Bb4
5.exd5 Qxd5 6.Nf3 {There is nothing better for White than 6
Bxc6 bxc6 7 Nf3.} Ne4 7.Bd2 Bxc3 8. bxc3 Nxd2 9.Qxd2 Nd7
10.Bd3 c5 11.c4 Qd6 12.c3 b6 13.O-O Bb7 14.Qe3 O-O 15.Rad1
{White should force the exchange of the Black Queen Bishop by
15 Be4 Bxe4 16 Qxe6 Rc8 17 Rac1. White should hardly get more
than a draw out of this position.} Rad8 16.Rfe1 Qc7 17.Bf1 a6
{? This gives White some chances, since it not merely weakens
the Black b-pawn, but also stops the Black Queen Bishop from
attacking White's weak c4 via a6. Black should have played
17...Bxf3 18 Qxf3 e5.} 18.Nd2 Nf6 19.Nb3 Rc8 20.Rb1 Rfd8
21.dxc5 bxc5 22.Qxc5 Qxc5 23.Nxc5 Rxc5 {The b-pawn being weak
anyhow Black sacrifices it so as to seek some compensation in
open files.} 24.Rxb7 Ra5 25.Rd1 Rc8 26.Rc7 Rb8 27. c5 Ne4
{27...Rxa2 was ruled out on account of 28 c6, followed by Rb7
and c7.} 28.Rcd7 {The threat being c4.} Kf8 29.c6 Rc5 30.c4
Nf6 31.c7 Re8 32.R7d6 a5 33.Ra6 Ke7 34.Rb1 Rxc7 35.Rxa5 Ne4
36.Rc1 Rd8 37.f3 Nd2 38.Be2 Rd4 39.Kf2 e5 {A desperate attempt
to rescue the Knight. 39...Nxc4 would have been refuted by
Ra4.} 40. Rxe5+ Kf6 41.Rb5 Nxc4 42.Rb4 {42...Nd6 would be
refuted by Rxd4; any other Knight move by Rb6+.} 1-0
