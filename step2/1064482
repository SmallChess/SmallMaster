1.e4 {Notes by H. N. Pillsbury} e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4
Nf6 5.Nc3 d6 6.O-O {Premature; d4 is more usual and better.}
Bd7 { For Black could obtain a very good counter-attack at
once by b5; 7 Bb3 Bg4 threatening Nd4, etc.} 7.d4 b5 8.dxe5
{Of course forced, for if 8 Bb3 Nxd4 9 Nxd4 exd4 10 Qxd4 c5
and c4 winning the Bishop.} dxe5 9.Bb3 Bd6 10.Bg5 h6 11.Bh4 g5
12.Bg3 Kf8 {Black’s plan of counter-attack with the Pawns
seems to be quite correct, and the King is well placed here.}
13.Bd5 Qe7 14.Qd2 Re8 15.Rae1 Nd8 16.Bb3 Bg4 17.Qe3 c6 18.Rd1
Bc7 {Black plays too timidly ; either Nh5 or Ne6 was perfectly
safe and more attacking. White could not afford Qb6 in either
case.} 19.a4 Nd7 20.axb5 axb5 21.Qa7 Bxf3 22.gxf3 Nc5 23.Ba2
Kg7 {Something more attacking is needed all along
here. Perhaps h5; 24 h3 Ne6 and f4 would be stronger than the
text.} 24.Rd2 Nde6 25.Bxe6 Nxe6 26.Rfd1 Bb8 {Why not Nd4.}
27.Qxe7 Rxe7 28.Rd7 Rhe8 29.Kg2 Nd4 30.Rxe7 Rxe7 31.Rd2 f6
32.Nd1 Ne6 33.Ne3 Kg6 34.Nf5 Rc7 35.c3 Rf7 36.h4 Bc7 37.Rd1
Nc5 {Black should by all means have dislodged the adverse
Knight by Ng7, and he had then rather the best of it, owing to
the imprisoned White Bishop. White from this stage outplays
him at all points, and never offers him another opportunity
for so doing.} 38.Rh1 h5 39.hxg5 fxg5 40.Ra1 Na4 41.b3 Nb6 {If
Nxc3, White answers Rc1, with a winning game.} 42.Ra6 Kf6
43.c4 bxc4 44.bxc4 c5 45.Ne3 {Winning a Pawn and the game} Kg7
46.Bxe5+ Bxe5 47.Rxb6 Rf4 48.Rb7+ Kg6 49.Nd5 Rf8 50.Rb6+ Kf7
51.Rc6 Bd4 52.Rc7+ Ke6 {If Kg6 53 Ne7+ Kf6 54 Nf5, winning a
second Pawn in a few moves.} 53.Rh7 h4 54.f4 {With this and
the entrance of the King on the next move, the result of the
game becomes only a question of time.} gxf4 55.Kf3 Ke5 56.Rh5+
Kd6 57.Rxh4 Rb8 58.Rh6+ Ke5 59.Rh5+ Kd6 60.Nxf4 Rb4 61.Rd5+
