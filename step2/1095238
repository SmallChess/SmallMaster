1.d4 {Notes by Frank Marshall} Nf6 2.Nf3 b6 3.g3 Bb7 4.Bg2 e6
{Here or on the next move ...c5 would have been an excellent
idea, as White would have been unable to push by with the
d-pawn.} 5.O-O Be7 6.c4 c5 {? But now this is distinctly
inferior, because White's reply gives him an enormous
advantage in terrain.} 7.d5 {!} exd5 8.Nh4 Qc8 9.cxd5 d6 10.e4
O-O 11.Nf5 Re8 {Black suffers from a serious lag in
development which can never be made up.} 12.Nc3 Bf8 13.Bg5 a6
{His difficulties are already serious enough without being
enhanced by the broken-up king-side which results from this
move, ...Nbd7 should have been played.} 14.Bxf6 gxf6 15.Bh3
Qd8 16.Qg4+ Kh8 17.Qh5 Qc7 18.Nh6 Bxh6 {Forced, for if
18...Re7 or ...Kg7, 19 Bf5 wins.}19.Qxh6 Nd7 20.f4 Rg8 21.Bxd7
Qxd7 22.Qxf6+ Rg7 {Black's game is hopeless, not only has he
lost a pawn, he is subjected to a formidable attack.} 23.f5
Re8 24.Rae1 Re5 {If 24...Qd8 25 Qh6 maintains the attack.}
25.Ne2 {!} Kg8 {There is no defence against the coming inroad
of the knight. If 25...Rxe4 26 Nf4 Rxe1 27 Rxe1 followed by
Nh5 and wins.} 26.Nf4 h6 27.Nh5 Rh7 28.Qxe5 {!} 1-0
