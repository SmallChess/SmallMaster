1. d4 { Dear Chess Friends: Among the multitude of games
played by my late husband, Jose Raul Capablanca, there is one
that has never been published nor even seen by anyone except
the three of us: Capablanca, Tartakower and myself. In the
years that I had known Capa he had never played in private, he
had never practised, nor even had a chess set at home. Ever so
different from the chess masters all over the world! This was,
however, a very special occasion. It happened in Paris. I
believe the year was 1938. We stayed in the Hotel Regina,
Place Jeanne D'Arc, quite near the Louvre Museum. I had one of
my frequent bad colds and stayed in bed to recuperate, when
Savielly Tartakower, one of our good friends, came over for a
visit. He stayed quite a while. Then suddenly he said to Capa:
"I have a chess set with me. Why not play a game?" Much to my
astonishment, Capa smiled. "Why not? We are in good company."
He grabbed some of the hotel stationery, a small table was
moved close to my bed and the two masters sat down to
play. How long the game lasted I couldn't quite tell, as here
and there I slept a little. I remember Capa woke me up by
gently touching my shoulder, to give me a few folded sheets of
Regina stationery, on which he had written the score of Capa v
Tartakower. Of course he won. "Here is a present for you,
cherie." Gingerly I took the folded stationery. "But you know
I don't understand a thing about chess." Both he and
Tartakower laughed good naturedly. "Take it and hide it
well. Some day in years to come it will buy you a beautiful
bijou", Capa said. "Ever since I was a child everything I did
was written down. And this is the only chess game that is only
yours." Anyone wishing to buy the Capablanca jewel, as he
referred to it, should write as soon as possible to Mr Edward
Winter [...]. 30 September would be the appropriate time
limit, as I have authorized him to receive the bids on my
behalf. In view of the exceptional nature of the game and
surrounding circumstances, no offer under $US 10,000 will be
accepted. With sincerest good wishes to all chess players in
all lands. Olga Capablanca Clark, 28 April 1987 } Nf6 2. c4 b6
