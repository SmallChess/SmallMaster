1. e4 {Notes by J. R. Capablanca} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6
4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Nxe4 6. d4 b5 7. Bb3 d5 8. a4 {8.dxe5 is the
usual continuation} Nxd4 $1 9. Nxd4 exd4 10. Qxd4 {If 10.axb5
Bc5, with a fine game. 10...Nc5 in answer to 10.axb5, as
suggested by I. Gunsberg, would not do, as White gets the
better game by playing 11.QXd4.} Be6 11. c3 c5 {11...Bc5!
would have led to a most interesting situation. In fact, it
looks as if White would get the worst of it. 11...Bc5 12.Qxg7
Kd7, and I cannot see any good way for White to get away from
the terrific attack. As 13...Qh4 is threatened, White's best
move is probably 13.Qh6, then 13...Rg8 14.Be3 (seems best)
14...Rg6 15.Qh5 and now without going into any further attacks
Black gets the better game by playing 15...Bxe3 16.fxe3 Qg5
17.Qg5 Rxg5.} 12. Qe5 Qb8 $16 13. Qxb8+ Rxb8 14. axb5 axb5
{After all these exchanges, Black comes out a pawn ahead. If
that is the best that White can obtain from a4 on the eight
move, it cannot be recommended. The advance seems premature.}
15. Na3 Be7 {15...b4 seems to be the proper move; and if
16.Ba4+ Bd7. The text move gives White a chance to gain lost
ground.} 16. Bf4 Rb7 17. f3 Nf6 18. Nxb5 O-O {If 18...Rxb5
19.Ba4 Bd7 20.Bxb5 Bxb5 21.Re1 and Black must lose a
piece. Mr. I. Gunsberg's suggestion that if 18...Rxb5 19.Ra8+
is not correct, as Black could then play 19...Kd7, and have
two pieces for a rook.} 19. Ba4 $5 c4 {If 19...Bd7 20.c4 dxc4
21.Nc3.} 20. Ra2 $1 $16 20... Bc5+ 21. Kh1 $1 Bd7 22. Bd6 Bxd6
{Black could also play 22...Rxb5 23.Bxf8 Bxf8 24.Bxb5 Bxb5,
and White would now have two exchanges for a piece. Too bad
Schlechter did not play this way. It would have been a great
ending to play.} 23. Nxd6 Rb6 24. Bxd7 Nxd7 25. Nf5 $13 Re8
26. Ra7 Nf6 27. Ra2 g6 28. Nd4 Reb8 29. Rf2 Nd7 30. h3 Nc5
31. Rd2 Nd3 32. b4 $1 cxb3 33. Nxb3 Rxb3 34. Rxd3 Rc8 35. Rxd5
Rbxc3 1/2-1/2
