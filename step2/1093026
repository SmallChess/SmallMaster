1.d4 {Notes by Geza Maroczy} Nf6 2.Nf3 e6 3.e3 b6 4.Bd3 Bb7
5.O-O Be7 6.b3 {Morrison adopts the old Zukertort style of
attack in the queen's pawn opening.} O-O 7.Bb2 {He should
first play Nbd2 to prevent his opponent playing Ne4.} Ne4 8.c4
f5 9.Nc3 Qe8 10.Qc2 Nxc3 11.Bxc3 Qh5 12.Qe2 Na6 {Tempting
White to weaken his pawn position by playing c4.} 13.c5 Nb8
14.b4 Bf6 15.Rac1 Nc6 16.e4 {Better would have been a3. The
text move leaves a "hole" at d4, where the knight subsequently
lodges.} Ne7 17.e5 Nd5 18.Bd2 {If 18 exf6 then 18...Nf4 19 Qe3
Nxg2 20 Qg5 (of course if 20 Kxg2 then 20...Qg4+ 21 Kh1 Bxf3+
winning the queen) Qxg5 21 Nxg5 Nf4 22 Rfd1 gxf6 and White's
knight has no escape. If 22 fxg7 then 22...Rf6 threatening rg6
again winning the knight.} Be7 19.Ne1 Qf7 20.f4 {White has now
the better position.} Rab8 21.Bc4 bxc5 22.bxc5 h6 23.Nc2 g5
24.Rb1 gxf4 25.Rb3 {Threatening to win the bishop by Rfb1.}
Bc6 26.Bxf4 Nxf4 27.Rxf4 Kh7 28.Ne3 {White here overlooked
that he could have gained a pawn by Rxf5 with probably a
winning position.} Bg5 29.Rxf5 Bxe3+ 30.Qxe3 Qg6 31.Rf2 Bxg2
{Clever play.} 32.Rxb8 {If instead 32 Rxg2 Black would have
won brilliantly by 32...Qb1+ 33 Rxb1 Rxb1+ and mate in two
moves.} Be4 33.Qg3 Rxb8 34.Qxg6+ Kxg6 35.Rf6+ Kg7 36.Rf4 Bf5
37.Rf3 Rb1+ 38.Kf2 Rb2+ 39.Kg3 Rd2 40.Rf4 a5 41.h4 c6 42.Kf3
a4 43.Ke3 Rc2 44.Ba6 Rxa2 45.Bc8 Ra3+ 46.Ke2 Rc3 47.Bxd7 a3
48.d5 cxd5 49.c6 Kf7 50.Ra4 Ke7 51.Ra8 d4 52.Re8+ Kf7 53.Ra8
Be4 54.Ra7 Rc2+ 55.Ke1 a2 56.Kd1 d3 57.Bc8 Kg6 {White has no
resource against the threat of Bf3+ followed by d2+. A highly
interesting game.} 0-1
