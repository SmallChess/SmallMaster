1. e4 { Notes by Raymond Keene. Nimzowitsch played what is now
known as the Milner-Barry Gambit rather infrequently, but he
had one particular success which must have given him very
great pleasure.} 1...c5 2. c3 e6 3. d4 d5 4. e5 Nc6 5. Nf3 Qb6
6. Bd3 cxd4 7. cxd4 Bd7 8. Be2 {Not the pure Milner-Barry,
which should not be bad for Black after 8 O-O Nxd4 9 Nxd4 Qxd4
10 Nc3 a6! and it is not clear that White has enough
compensation for the pawn. It may also be possible for Black
to play 10...Qxe5; in a more recent game (Netanya 1971)
Westerinen scored a fine success with this over Bisguier: 11
Re1 Qb8 12 Nxd5 Bd6 13 Qh5 (13 Qg4! is stronger) 13...Kf8 14
Nc3 Nf6 15 Qh4 Bc6 16 Bg5 Be5-+. } 8...Nge7 9. b3 Nf5 10. Bb2
Bb4+ 11. Kf1 {Black's next maintains pressure on the d-pawn,
but Nimzowitsch shows that Black should have played 11...O-O!
12 g4 (12 Bd3 f6 13 Bxf5 exf5) 12...Nh6 13 Rg1 f6 14 exf6
Rxf6! 15 g5 Rxf3! 16 Bxf3 (or 16 gxh6 Rf7) 16...Nf5 17 Rg4 Be8

22 Nc3 Bxc3 23 Bxc3 d4) 22...exd5 23 Qxf5 Rf8 24 Qxd5+ Rf7! 25
Qd4 Bc5 and White must resign. } 11...Be7 12. g3 a5 {?} 13. a4
Rc8 14. Bb5 Nb4 15. Nc3 {! L. Paulsen-Tarrasch, Nuremberg
1888, had gone 15 Bxd7+? Kxd7 16 Nc3 Nc6 17 Nb5 Na7 18 Nxa7?
Qxa7 19 Qd3 Qa6!, and Tarrasch won a fine ending after the
exchange of queens. } 15...Na6 {In Dreihundert Schachpartien,
the second edition published in 1909, Tarrasch gives
15...Bxb5+ 16 Nxb5 Nc2 with the threat of ...Ne3+; this
Nimzowitsch shows to be harmless: 17 Rc1 Ne3+ 18 fxe3 Nxe3+ 19
Ke2 Nxd1 20 Rxc8+ Kd7 21 Rxh8 Nxb2 22 Rc1 and wins. } 16. Kg2

-- Nimzowitsch. } 37. Bxd4 Nxd4 38. Qxg7 Qf3+ 39. Qg2 Qxg2+
40. Rxg2 Nxb3 41. h4 {After his game with Tarrasch,
Nimzowitsch decided that 6 Bd3 was too risky, and in
subsequent games (before he discovered 4 Qg4) he developed the
king's bishop on a more modest square, e2, although this cut
out the possibility of reaching the position from his Salwe
game. Here is one example: Nimzowitsch-Spielmann, Stockholm
1920. http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1102388}
