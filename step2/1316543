{I had published, some months previously, an analysis of the
variation 11...d4, and I gave the text moves as an example of
a simple way for White to play against it in order to obtain
the better game. I left off at the above position, stating
that White had the better game. Chajes and a few other local
players studied the analysis, and came to the conclusion that
was wrong. They thought that Black had at least as good a game
as White; in fact, better. Therefore Chajes availed himself of
the first opportunity to prove his contention. I was ignorant
of all this at the time, and was consequently very much
surprised at his "falling" (as I thought) into my published
variation, and commented on it to one of the spectators, who
then enlightened me as to the true reason of his play. The
game, I hope, will show that my judgment was better than his,
as at no point of the proceedings was I in danger of obtaining
anything worse than a draw. The advantage of White rests
mainly on the strength of the pawn at e5, which largely
restricts the action of the Black pieces, while it gives
plenty of freedom for the maneuvering of the White forces.}
Rd8 16. Qxd7+ Bxd7 17. Rd1 Ne7 {Black could not castle because
of 18. Be3! Bxe3 19. Rxd7! Rxd7 20. Bxc6 and White will come
out with two minor pieces for a Rook and two pawns.} 18. Nd4
h6 {A bad move, which shows that Black did not properly
understand the position. He wants to prevent the pinning of
the Knight by Bg5 and does not realize that the posting of the
White Bishop at a3 (after Nb3) is much more important. He
should now castle when White's best move would probably be
19.Be3} 19.Nb3 Bb6 20.Ba3 h5 {He now must attempt to bring his
King's Rook into the game in this way.} 21.Rd3 Bg4 22. Rxd8+
Kxd8 23. Nc5 Rh6 {He naturally avoids the alternative
23... Bxc5 which would leave White with two Bishops in an open
position.} 24.h3 Bc8 25. Rd1+ Ke8 26. Kf1 g5 {To prevent
27.f4, which was the intention, revealed by White's last
move.} 27. Nd3 f5 {White threatened to win a pawn by
28.Bc1. Besides, the pawn at e5 completely blocks the free
maneuvering of Black's pieces; therefore in desperation he
advances the f-pawn to get rid of White's e-pawn, and thus
have breathing space.} 28. exf6 Rxf6 29. Re1 Be6 {29... Re6
would be no better, as then White could play either 30. Bg6+!
Rxg6 31. Rxe7+ Kd8 32. Ne5 threatening the Rook, and 33.Nf7
mate.} 30. Bf3 Rh6 {Not good, but there was no way to avoid
the loss of a pawn, which in such positions means the loss of
the game. If 30... h4 31. Bg4 and if 30... g4 31. hxg4 hxg4
32. Bxg4 Bxg4 33. Rxe7+ Kd8 34. Rg7 winning.} 31. Bxh5+ Kd7
32. Bg4 Nc6 33. Rxe6 Rxe6 34. Bc1 Kd6 35. Bxe6 Kxe6 {He might
have resigned, as he will now be two pawns behind, without any
compensation whatever for them.} 36. Bxg5 Ba5 37. Bd2 Kd5
38. h4 Ne5 39. Nxe5 Kxe5 40. h5 c5 41. g4 Kf6 42. Ke2 c4
43. f4 Kf7 44. Kf3 Bd8 45. Ke4 a5 46. Kd5 Be7 47. g5 Kg8
