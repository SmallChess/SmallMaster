1.Nf3 {Notes by Frank Marshall} Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 {d4
would have been more exact, as Black's reply indicates.} e5
{!} 5.d4 exd4 6.Nxd4 O-O 7.Be2 Re8 8.f3 c6 {! Black's hitherto
inexplicable avoidance of the almost obligatory ...d6 now
becomes clear. He intends to advance the d-pawn two squares,
even at the cost of sacrificing a pawn.} 9.Nc2 d5 {!?} 10.cxd5
{A very puzzling position, but 10 exd5 cxd5 11 Nxd5 Nxd5 12
Qxd5 would have been relatively better.} cxd5 11.Nxd5 {No
better is 11 exd5 Qb6! with a very awkward position for
White.} Nxd5 12.Qxd5 Qc7 13.Qc4 Nc6 14.Ne3 {White's position
is anything but enviable; the omission of castling ultimately
proves disastrous, but 15 O-O Be6 16 Qa4 (if 16 Qd3 Rad8 17
Qe3 Nd4, etc.) a6 likewise leaves him with a poor game. Black
has indeed obtained excellent value for the pawn.} Be6 {He
does not fear the seemingly formidable 15 Nd5 which is simply
answered by ...Qd8 with a view to ...Nd4 and ...Rc8.} 15.Qc2
Be5 {! Virtually decisive, since White has little to hope for
from 16 h3 Bg3+, etc.} 16.g3 Bxg3+ {! Relying on his superior
development.} 17.hxg3 Qxg3+ 18.Kd1 Rad8+ 19.Bd2 Nd4 {Since a
queen move is refuted by Nxf3, White tries an exchange of
queens, but this also proves inadequate.} 20.Nf1 Nxc2 21.Nxg3
Nxa1 22.e5 {Despair; if instead 22 b3 Bxb3+ 23 axb3 Nxb3 24
Nf1 Rxd2+ 25 Nxd2 Rd8 etc.} Bxa2 23.f4 Nb3 24.Ne4 Rxd2+ {White
resigns. Triumph of the open lines!} 0-1
