1.d4 {Notes by J.R. Capablanca} d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Nf3
Nbd7 5.e3 { On general principles it is better to bring the
Queen’s Bishop out first.} Be7 6.Bd3 O-O 7.O-O dxc4 8.Bxc4 c5
9.Qe2 a6 10.Rd1 b5 11.Bd3 Bb7 12.e4 { Played in order to
develop the Queen’s Bishop and thereby condemning his whole
plan of development, since he could have done that before, as
indicated in the previous note, and the only reason he could
have had for playing e3 on the fifth move would have been to
develop this Bishop via b2.} cxd4 13.Nxd4 Ne5 14.Nb3 { The
combination beinning with Bxb5, followed by Nxe6, are wrong,
viz., 14 Bxb5 axb5; 15 Nxe6 fxe6; 16 Rxd8 Raxd8; 17 Qxby Nxe4,
and Black has a won game.} Nxd3 15.Rxd3 Qc7 16.e5 { White
could not play Bg5 because of the rejoinder, Nxe4.} Nd5 17.Rg3
Nxc3 18.Rxc3 Qd7 {It was my impression that, after this
move,Black had a very superior game. } 19.Rg3 Rfd8 20.Bh6 g6
21.Be3 Qd5 { This leads to the exchange of one of the two
Bishops, but it would be very difficult to find a better
move.} 22.Na5 Rac8 23.Nxb7 Qxb7 24.Bh6 Qd5 25.b3 Qd4 { It was
probably here where Black failed to make the best move.25…Bb4
was the better move.} 26.Rf1 Rd5 27.Re3 Ba3 {Bf8 was better,
as white could not very well afford to take the Bishop; he
would be compelled to play first Re4, to be followed later on
by Bf4.} 28.g3 Qb2 29.Re1 Rc2 {Qxe2 followed by Bb4 was the
proper course to follow.} 30.Qf3 Be7 {This was my thirtieth
move; I was very much pressed for time and I could not make
the necessary analysis to find out whether Bf8 would have been
a winning or losing move.If 30…Bf8 31.Bxf8 Kxf8 32. Qf6
Kg8. 33.h4 and Black would have a very difficult position to
defend.} 31.R3e2 Rxe2 {Qxa2 now would lose because of 32.Rxc2
Qxc2 33.Rc1 followed by Rc8+,etc.} 32.Rxe2 Qb1+ 33.Kg2 Bf8
34.Bf4 h6 35.h4 b4 36.Qe4 Qxe4+ 37.Rxe4 Kg7 38.Rc4 Bc5 39.Kf3
g5 40.hxg5 hxg5 41.Bxg5 1/2-1/2
