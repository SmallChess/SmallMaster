exd5 5.Nc3 Nc6 6.g3 Nf6 7.Bg2 Be6 8.O-O Be7 9.dxc5 Bxc5 10.Bg5
d4 {I had never seen this variation before and I therefore
thought for a long time in order to make up my mind as to
whether I should play Bxf6 or Ne4. I finally decided upon the
latter move as the safest course.} 11.Ne4 Be7 12.Nxf6+ Bxf6
13.Bxf6 Qxf6 {It is my position that this position is not good
for Black, though perhaps there may be no way to force a win.}
14.Qa4 O-O 15.Qb5 {Threatening not only the b Pawn, but also
Qg5, exchanging Queens.} Rab8 16.Rfd1 h6 17.Ne1 Rfe8 18.Rd2
{Bxc6 would only lead to a draw. Viz, 18.Bxc6 bxc6 19.Qxc6
Rec8 followed by Rxb2.} Bg4 19.Rc1 Re5 20.Qd3 {If Rc5 Qg5 with
a winning game.} Rbe8 21.Bf3 Bxf3 {Black could have tried to
keep up the attack by playing h5. The text move simplifies
matters and easily leads to a draw.} 22.Nxf3 Re4 23.Rc4 Qe6
24.Nxd4 Nxd4 1/2-1/2
