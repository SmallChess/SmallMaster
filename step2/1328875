1. e4 {One of eight simultaneous blindfold games. Notes by
J. Lowenthal} e5 2. Bc4 Bc5 3. b4 Bb6 4. Nf3 d6 5. d4 exd4
6. Nxd4 Nf6 7. Nc3 O-O 8. O-O Nxe4 9. Nxe4 d5 10. Bg5 Qe8
11. Bxd5 {from this point, to the very end, the game abounds
with interesting positions.} c6 12. Re1 Qd7 13. Nf6+ gxf6
14. Bxf6 Qd6 {If Mr. Freeman had taken the bishop with queen,
Re5, in reply, would have proved a winning move; and if with
pawn, the following variation would most likely have ocurred:
14...cxd5 15 Re5 h6 16 Qh5 (16 Rg5+ Kh7 17 Qd3+ or 16...hxg5
17 Qh5 also wins) Kh7 17 Nf5 wins.} 15. Ne6 Bxe6 16. Qh5 Bxf2+
17. Kh1 {If White had captured the bishop, ...Qf4+ would have
effectually relieved Black from his embarrasments.} Qf4
18. Rxe6 {Ingenious and quite accurate.} Nd7 19. Bb2
{Threatening mate by Rg6+.} Bd4 20. g3 Nf6 {If ...Qf2, White
would have won with ease by checking with the queen at g4.}
21. gxf4 Nxh5 22. Bxd4 {The combination is carried out and
completed with due mathematical precision; and after the
pieces are exchanged off, White will remain with an advantage
quite sufficient to insure victory.} Nxf4 23. Rg1+ Ng6
24. Rexg6+ hxg6 25. Rxg6+ Kh7 26. Rg7+ Kh6 27. Be4 f5 28. Bd3
