5.Nd5 Nxd5 6.exd5 e4 7.dxc6 dxc6 8.Be2 {Bc4 is better.} exf3
9.Bxf3 O-O 10.O-O f5 11.c3 {This only drives the Bishop to a
stronger position. d4 at once is certainly better.} Bd6
12.Qb3+ {A useless check; the Queen is completely out of play
for the rest of the game. d4 was the correct move.} Kh8 13.d4
Qh4 14.g3 Qf6 15.h3 h5 16.Kg2 h4 17.Rg1 {White is now in
difficulties, but this move makes matters worse. Qc2
preventing the move Qg6 seems to be the only move.} hxg3
18.fxg3 f4 19.Bxf4 {This loses a piece, but gxf4 is not much
better, as in the latter case Qh4 wins easily.} g5 20.Bxd6
