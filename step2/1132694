1. e4 {Notes by H. N. Pillsbury} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5
4. c3 Qe7 {Perhaps not so good as ...Nf6, but favoured by
Dr. Pollock.} 5. d4 Bb6 6. a4 { Advances of this character so
early seem premature, and only weaken the position later
on. Although this includes a trap-- viz, if in answer 6...d6;
7 a5 winning two Pieces for Rook and Pawn, yet it is no
exception to the foregoing rule. Any developing move, as
6. Castles, would be better.} a5 7. O-O d6 8. d5 {Rather than
this advance, which allows Black later on to open the game at
his leisure on the King’s side, the lesser evil of the two,
...h6, would be preferable. Black could form no immediate
assault upon this point, and his somewhat weakened Queen’s
wing would scarcely permit him to Castle on that side, with
intent of a Pawn attack on the White King.} Nd8 9. Bd3 Nf6
{The position would permit of a direct assault upon the
Castled King, should Black desire, by 9...f6 , followed soon
by ...g5 and ...h5. In answer 10 Nh4 would be disastrous by
io...g5 11 Qh5+ Nf7 12Nf3 Bd7!, followed by O-O-O, now
permissible owing to the displacement of the White Queen.}

cxd5 16. exd5 Nf7 17. Re1 O-O {With a fine position for attack
; a direct evidence of the weakness of White’s 8th move.}
18. Nd4 Qf6 19. Nb5 Bb6 20. bxa5 {Only still further weakening
his pawns} Bxa5 21. Be2 Ng7 22. Bd2 Bd7 23. Rf1 Rac8 24. c4
Bb6 25. Be3 {Qb3, with intent to force matters on the Queen’s
side, seems better.} Bxe3 26. fxe3 Ng5 27. Nc3 { A violation
of an old-time principle ‘that the pieces should not be left
loose and unguarded.’ Black takes advantage of this misplay
with great precision, and from this point obtains a winning
advantage. White should have played 27.Qc2 and if ...Ne4 28
Nc3 Nc5 29 a5, with a fair prospect of attack on the weak
b-pawn. } f4 28. Qc2 f3 29. Nh4 Nf5 { Perhaps ...Bh3 was
quicker, for if 30 Rf2 Bg2, wins without much trouble.}
