1. Nf3 { Notes by Raymond Keene. } c5 2. c4 g6 3. d4 Bg7
4. Nc3 {Better is 4 e4; see my game with Timman (below).}
4...cxd4 5. Nxd4 Nc6 6. e3 {!? My own idea - I won't try it
again. The plan is 6...Nxd4 7 exd4 Nf6 8 d5 or 6...Nf6 7 Nc2
d6 8 Be2 O-O 9 O-O Be6 10 Nd5 with the better game for White
in either case. But ...} 6...Nf6 7. Nc2 d6 8. Be2 Be6 {!
Played before ...O-O with the intention of threatening an
immediate ...d6-d5, while 9 Nd5 loses pawn since ...Qa5+ is
on.} 9. e4 Nd7 10. Nd5 {White should play 10 Bd2 O-O 11 O-O
Nc5 12 b4 Bxc3 13 Bxc3 Nxe4 14 Bb2 with clear compensation for
the pawn.} 10...Nc5 11. f3 f5 12. exf5 Bxf5 13. O-O O-O {Black
obviously has some initiative now, and White must fight to
maintain himself.} 14. Nce3 e6 {! Giving up the bishop for a
powerful pawn wedge.} 15. Nxf5 gxf5 16. Nf4 {16 Nc3 Bxc3! is
good for Black.} 16...Bd4+ 17. Kh1 e5 18. Nd5 f4 {Unpleasant
threats loom up, for example ...Rf5-h5 followed by ...Rxh2+
and ...Qh4 mate. It is obviously necessary for White now to
play very actively.} 19. g3 {!} Qg5 20. gxf4 exf4 21. b4 {!
Excellent. 21...Bxa1 22 Rg1 is good for White. Black should
probably play positionally now with 21...Ne6 (which Tal wrote
on his scoresheet and crossed out) but instead he offers an
interesting exchange sacrifice - the only difficulty being
that White need not accept!} 21...Kh8 {Planning 22 Bxf4 Rxf4
23 Nxf4 Qxf4 24 bxc5 dxc5 with advantage to Black in my
opinion (thanks to the dark square control). However, ...}
22. Rg1 {!! Forcing Black to accept an exchange sacrifice
himself. The initiative now passes over to White.} 22...Qxg1+
23. Qxg1 Bxg1 24. Kxg1 Nd7 {24...Ne6 25 Bb2+ Kg8 26 c5 dxc5 27
Bc4 and the bishops gun Black down.} 25. Bb2+ Nce5 26. Rd1 Rf7
27. Rd4 {Hoping for 27...Raf8 28 c5 dxc5 29 Re4 Re8 30 Bb5!
winning; but in view of Tal's next good move, 27 Nc7! at once
was the only chance to play for a win.} 27...Kg8 {! The black
f-pawn is not so important.} 28. Nc7 Rc8 29. Nb5 Nc6 30. Rd5
Re7 31. Rg5+ Kf8 32. Rf5+ {We saw no way in the post mortem
for White to play for a win with the bishop on e2 and pawn on
b4 hanging. A draw is now the logical result.} 1/2-1/2
