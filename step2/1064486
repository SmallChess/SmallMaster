1.e4 {Notes by C. von Bardeleben} e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.c3 Nf6 {I
prefer the usual defence, d5.} 4.d4 Nxe4 5.d5 Nb8 6.Bd3 Nc5
7.Nxe5 Nxd3+ 8.Nxd3 Be7 9.O-O d6 10.c4 {White would have a
very good game if he played 10 Qf3 in order to prevent Black
developing his Queen’s Bishop.} O-O {Bf5 would be better.}
11.Nc3 { Again White should have played Qf3.} Bf5 {! After
this move has been made, the game is equalised.} 12. Qf3 {Too
late (!).} Bg6 13.Bf4 Nd7 14.Rfe1 Bf6 15.Rac1 Bxc3 16.Rxc3 Qf6
17.Qe3 h6 18.Bg3 Rae8 {White threatened to play 19 Qe7, and
therefore Black rightly gives two Rooks for the Queen.}
19.Qxe8 Rxe8 20.Rxe8+ Kh7 21.Re3 Qd4 22.h3 h5 23.Ne1 Be4
24.Nf3 Bxf3 25.Rxf3 Nf6 26.Rfd3 Qe4 27.f3 Qe2 28.Rb3 g5 29.Rd4
h4 30.Bf2 Nh5 31.Re4 Qd2 32.Rxb7 {This looks very dangerous,
but the attack of Black is not so strong as it seems to be.}
Qc1+ 33.Kh2 Qf1 34.Bg1 Ng3 35.Rg4 Kg6 36.Rxc7 f5 37.Rd4 Ne2
38.Be3 f4 {If Black takes the Rook with the Knight, the White
Pawns become very strong, and Black would have no better
chance than after the line adopted. } 39.Re4 {! Very cleverly
played. Of course now Black cannot capture the Bishop because
of 40. Re6+, and mate on the next move.} Qb1 {! The only way
to defend the King against the threatening 40 Re6+ Kh5 41 Rh7
mate.} 40.Re6+ Kh5 41.Bf2 Ng3 42.Be1 Nf1+ 43.Kg1 Ne3 44.Kh2
Nf1+ 45.Kg1 Ne3 46.Kh2 1/2-1/2
