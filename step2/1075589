1. e4 {Notes by J. Lowenthal} e5 2. f4 Bc5 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. fxe5
{We consider 4 Bb5 to be also a good move at this juncture.}
d5 {The sacrifice of the Knight here is not advisable, as the
variation appended will prove : 4...Nxe5 5 Nxe5 Qh4+ 6 g3 Qh4+
7 qe2 Qxe4+ 8 d4 (Ng6+ though apparently a good move is not
so; for after taking the rook the knight could not easily be
liberated) Be7 9 Nf3 d6 10 Be3 Bg4 11 Nbd2 and we prefer the
game of the first player.} 5. exd5 Qxd5 6. Nc3 Qd8 7. Ne4 Bb6
8. c3 Bg4 9. d4 Qd5 10. Nf2 Nxe5 11. Qe2 {It will be noticed
that if White had instead played 11 dxe5, Black would have
answered ...Bxf2+ and so obtained a decisive advantage.} Bxf3
12. gxf3 Qxf3 {When Mr. Rhodes sacrificed the piece, he no
doubt thought that after moving ...Kf8 he could bring his
queen's rook with grat effect to e8 or he would hardly have
dared to give up so much to so formidable an opponent.}
