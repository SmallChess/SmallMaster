{...c5 would have been a better move.} 10. O-O {If White had
captured the proffered bishop, Black would have checked with
the queen , regaining the piece and improving his position.}
Bxd3 11. Qxd3 Bc5 12. Nd2 Bxe3+ 13. Qxe3 Qb6 {We believe that
Mr. Avery acted prudently in exchanging off the pieces and
simplifying the game. Mr. Morphy having shown himself so
extremely accurate and skilful in complicated positions, which
in an endgame, playing blindfold, it was just possible that
his power of calculation might prove faulty.} 14. Rae1 O-O
