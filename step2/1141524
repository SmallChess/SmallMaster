1.e4 {Notes by H. N. Pillsbury} e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4
Nf6 5.d3 d6 6.c3 Be7 { A well-known form of the Lopez attack
has developed. Many masters, notably Tchigorin, prefer to
develop this Bishop at g7.} 7.Nbd2 O-O 8.Nf1 b5 9.Bb3
{Steinitz and others would prefer Bc2 at once.} d5 10.Qe2 dxe4
11.dxe4 Bc5 12.Ng3 Qe7 13.O-O {Generally the first player in
previous games in this opening has preferred to Castle Queen's
Rook, and prosecute the attack upon the adverse King by
advancing his Pawns ; but the Black Pawns would advance upon
the Queen's side too rapidly in this position, therefore
Dr. Tarrasch abandons this idea.} Na5 14.Bc2 Nc4 15.a4 {The
opened file proves of great service to White later on.} Rb8
16.axb5 axb5 17.b3 Nd6 18.Bg5 h6 19.Be3 Bb6 { Inasmuch as the
King's Pawn needs more protection soon, Black might have tried
here Nd7, being then prepared to support it by f6.} 20.Bxb6
Rxb6 21.Qe3 Rc6 {The movement of the Rook only loses time, and
leads to the direct loss of a Pawn later on. Moreover, Nd7 was
always correct to prevent the Queeen's entrance at c5.} 22.h3
Nb7 {Also loss of time.} 23.Rfc1 Re8 24.Bd3 Nd6 25.Ra5 {This
move might have won a clear Pawn.} Ra6 {An error: Rb6; 26 Qc5
Bb7 would have saved the Pawn.} 26.Rca1 {Unaccountable, except
perhaps on account of time-pressure: 26 Rxb5 Nxb5 27 Bxb5
would have won the Pawn clear.} Rxa5 27.Rxa5 Qd7 28.c4 c6
29.Ra7 Bb7 30.Qe2 bxc4 31.bxc4 c5 32.Qb2 Qc8 33.Nxe5 Qb8
34.Qa1 {A tremendous error which loses the exchange ; Ra5
still left White with the superior game.} Nc8 35.Rxb7 Qxb7
36.Ng4 Nxg4 37.hxg4 f6 38.Nf5 Qd7 39.Bc2 Qc7 40.Qa3 Nb6 41.g3
Ra8 42.Qb2 Nd7 43.Ne3 {White here exceeded his
time, and thereupon resigned. Black should win, however, being
soon able to enter the 8th row with combined Queen and Rook
and form a mating position, from which White could only escape
by decisive loss of material.} 0-1
