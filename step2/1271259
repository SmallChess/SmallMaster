1.e4 {Notes by Dr. Tarrasch.} e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Bxc6 {If
White can do this with impunity, (as indeed seems likely), a6
would be a pointless move.} dxc6 5.Nc3 Bc5 6.d3 Bg4 7.Be3 Qd6
8.Bxc5 Qxc5 9.Qd2 {!} Bxf3 {? A grievous misjudgement,
bringing disadvantage to Black. f6 was indicated.} 10.gxf3 Ne7
11.O-O-O Ng6 12.Qe3 {!} Qxe3+ {Not good because it strengthens
White's center. But after 12...Qe7 Black could not have
castled Q side on account of Qa7, whereas castling K-side
would have been dangerous on account of the open g-file. Black
is paying the penalty of his mistake on the 9th move.} 13.fxe3
Rd8 14.Ne2 f6 15.Rhg1 Kf7 {Castling was preferable.} 16.Rdf1
Rhe8 17.Ng3 Nf8 18.f4 c5 {The game is untenable. Black tries
to provide against 19 fxe5 Rxe5 20 d4 followed by e5; but
there is even worse to come.} 19.Nh5 g6 20.fxe5 {! To take the
Knight would allow a mate in 2.} Rxe5 21.Nxf6 Kg7 22.Rf2 h5
23.Nd5 c6 24.Nf4 c4 25.Rfg2 Rd6 26.h4 cxd3 27.cxd3 Kf7 28.Rg5
Rxg5 29.Rxg5 Rf6 30.e5 Rf5 31.Rxf5+ gxf5 32.d4 {Better than
Nxh5 which would be good enough too.} Ke7 33.Kd2 c5 34.Kd3
cxd4 35.exd4 Kd8 36.d5 Kd7 37.Kd4 Kc7 38.b4 Kd7 39.Kc5 Kc7
40.d6+ Kd7 41.Kd5 1-0
