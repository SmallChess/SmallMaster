1. e4 {Notes by C. von Bardeleben} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6
4. Ba4 d6 5. O-O Ne7 {I prefer Nf6 here} 6. c3 g6 7. d4 Bd7
8. Be3 Bg7 9. dxe5 dxe5 10. Nbd2 {Black being very cramped
rightly sacrifices a Pawn in order to get an easier game.} O-O
11. Re1 Nc8 12. Bc5 Re8 13. Nf1 b6 14. Ba3 N8a7 15. Qd3 Bc8
16. Qe2 Bb7 17. Ne3 b5 18. Bc2 b4 19. Bxb4 Nxb4 20. cxb4 Nb5
21. Qc4 {A weak move, which loses at once the gained
Pawn. Better would he 21 Nc4, to plant the Knight a5.} Nd6
22. Qb3 Nxe4 23. Rad1 Nd6 24. Nd5 {Nd2 would be better.} e4
25. Nd2 Bxd5 26. Qxd5 e3 {!} 27. Rxe3 Rxe3 28. fxe3 Rb8 {If
Bxb2 then 29 Nc4.} 29. Nc4 Rxb4 30. Bb3 {With 30 Nxd6 cxd6 31
Qxd6 Qxd6 32 Rxd6 Rxb2 33 Bb3 the game would have ended in a
draw. The move 30 Bb3 is somewhat dangerous.} Rb5 31. Qc6 Bf8
{!} 32. Qxa6 Qg5 33. Rf1 Nxc4 34. Bxc4 Qxe3+ 35. Kh1 Rf5
36. Ra1 {? A very weak move, after which the game of the first
player becomes hopeless. Black has in any case the better
game, but White could escape with a draw, perhaps, if he
played 36 Rxf5 gxf5 37 h3 Bc5 38 Kh2 Qg1+ 39 Kg3 Qf2+ 40 Kh2
Bd6+ 41 Kh1 Qe1+ 42 Bf1 Qg3 43 Kg1, etc.} Bd6 37. Bf1 {White
cannot save the game; if 37 h3, then Qg3, and Black wins.}
Bxh2 0-1
