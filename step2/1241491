1.e4 {Notes by J. R. Capablanca.} c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4
4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 e5 {Altogether unusual and I believe not very
good as Black's d pawn remains weak. It is not easy, however,
to discover how to get at it, and for a surprise the move
proved first-class, as Black got the better game.} 6.Nb3
{6.Ndb5, I believe was the right answer. Black would then have
to play 6...d6, not 6...Qa5 because of 7.Bc4 and if then
7...Nxe4 8.Bxf7+ Kxf7 9.Qd5+ with the better game.} Bb4 7.Bd3
d5 8.exd5 Nxd5 9.Bd2 Nxc3 10.bxc3 Bd6 {Black has now a
beautiful game, which shows that White's treatment of the
opening was not the best.} 11.Qh5 Qc7 12.O-O Be6 13.Bg5 h6
14.f4 {Sacrificing a pawn for an attack on the center against
the king. He might have played some move like 14.Rad1 and
waited for developments, as Black could not castle on either
side.} exf4 15.Rae1 Kd7 16.Bf5 Raf8 {Here is what Lasker
himself has to say about the situation, and I agree with him:
"Here Black could have played 16...Qb6+ 17.Kh1 g6. White could
not now sacrifice his queen, for after 18.Rxe6 gxh5 19.Re7+
Kd8 20.Rd7+ Ke8 21.Bf6 Be5, and White has no satisfactory
continuation. On the other hand, after 18.Bxe6+ fxe6 19.Qxg6
hxg5 20.Qxe6+ Kc7 21.Qf7+ Kb8 22.Nd4 Black would be confronted
by great difficulties, as White would threaten 23.Rb1,
followed by the sacrifice of the rook. But it has been proven
by analysis that I could have escaped all danger. The move
actually made appeared also very strong, but by a fine
combination Sclechter nearly equalized the game."} 17.Bxf4
Bxf4 18.Nc5+ Kc8 19.Bxe6+ fxe6 20.Nxe6 Bxh2+ {Right. Not
20...Qd6 because of 21.Nxf8 Rxf8 22.g3 Be5 23.Rxf8+ Qxf8
24.Rxe5 Nxe5 25.Qxe5 and White is a pawn ahead. Also, if
20...Qb6+ 21.Kh1 Bd6 22.Nxf8 Rxf8 23.Rxf8+ Bxf8 24.Qf5+ and
White is the exchange ahead. Also 20...Qb6+ 21.Kh1 g5 22.Nxf8
Rxf8 23.g3 Bd6 24.Rxf8+ Bxf8 25.Re8+ Nd8 26.Qh3+ Kc7 27.Rxf8
with the exchange to the good. Also 20...Qb6+ 21.Kh1 Bd6
22.Nxf8 Bxf8 23.Re8+ Nd8 24.Qf5+, followed by 25.Rxf8
winning.} 21.Qxh2 Rxf1+ 22.Rxf1 Qd7 23.Nc5 Qe7 24.Qh3+ Kb8
25.Ne6 Ka8 26.Nd4 Qc7 27.Qf5 Rc8 28.Qc5 Nb8 29.Qxc7 Rxc7 {The
attack is over and Black has the better game.} 30.Rf3 a6
31.Kf2 Nc6 32.Ne6 Re7 33.Re3 Kb8 34.Nd4 Rf7+ 35.Rf3 Rc7 36.Ne6
Re7 37.Re3 Kc8 {Black has skillfully improved his position.}
38.Ke2 Nd8 39.Nd4 Rf7 40.Rf3 Kd7 41.Rd3 Ke7 42.Re3+ Kd6 43.Rd3
Ne6 44.Nf3 Kc5 45.g3 Nc7 46.Nd2 Kc6 47.Nf3 Kb5 48.Rd4 Kc5
49.Nd2 Nb5 50.Nb3+ Kb6 51.Rd3 Rc7 52.Kd2 Rc4 53.Rd7 Rg4 54.c4
Kc6 55.Rd3 Nd6 56.Nd4+ Kc7 {Lasker says, "A regrettable
oversight; 56...Kb6 would have won the game." It is indeed
unfortunate that he did not play 56...Kb6. Lasker had very
skillfully brought his advantage to a point where it would
tell and at the moment he is going to reap the fruit of his
fine play, makes a slip and fails to win the game that was
almost a necessity for him.} 57.Ne6+ Kc6 58.Nd8+ Kc7 59.Ne6+
Kd7 60.Nxg7 Ke7 61.Nh5 Rxc4 62.Re3+ Kf7 63.Rf3+ Kg6 64.Rf6+
Kxh5 65.Rxd6 1/2-1/2
