1. d4 {Annotations by Emanuel Lasker} d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6
4. Bg5 Be7 5. e3 O-O 6. Nf3 b6 7. Bd3 {Pillsbury's
continuation was 7.cxd5 exd5 8.Bd3 with the intent of
castling, placing his knight on e5, his pawn on f4, and of
attacking the adverse King in a variety of manners. This
attack has been often conducted with success, but games lately
played by Teichmann indicate that by means of a timely retreat
of the knight to e8 the defense gains the upper
hand. Mr. Speijer conducts the opening in the style of Burn.}

13. Bb1 Nd5 {White prepa res for e4-e5, Ne4 and massing of
pieces on the kingside. Black must foil this plan.} 14. Bxe7 {
14.Ne4 was a possibility, but an advantage thereby not
apparent.} Qxe7 15. e4 Nxc3 16. bxc3 Rfc8 17. Qe3 a5 18. e5
{He now prepares Ng5 (or Nd2-e4-d6).} Bxf3 19. gxf3 {To
strengthen his center and to provide open lines for an
attack.} Nb6 20. Kh1 {20.Be4 was here essential. The important
square d5 should not be left to the knight without a
struggle. Now the attack of Black comes so quick that the
counter attack of White must fail.} Nd5 21. Qd3 g6 22. Rg1 b4

28. Rxb1 { 28.Qh6 Nc3 29.Rh3 would not avail White because of
29...Nd5} c3 29. Qf4 { If 29.Qh6 Qxd4 30.Rh3 Qxe5 and Black
must win the endgame.} Qxa2 30. Rbg1 Qd2 31. Qh4 c2 32. Rh3 h6
