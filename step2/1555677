1.d4 {At the start of his career Anand played incredibly
quickly which explains the following. -- Comments by Malcolm
Pein from the Daily Telegraph.} d5 2.Nf3 a6 {A number of
Indian GMs played this way at the time including Dibyendu
Barua. If White continues with c4 Black has the option of dxc4
and then b7-b5 trying to keep the pawn. Precisely the kind of
thing one wants to avoid against a tactical genius. I resolved
to be as boring as possible.} 3.Bf4 Nf6 4.e3 c5 5.dxc5
{Playing the Queen's Gambit Accepted in reverse with an extra
tempo.} Nc6 {?!} 6.c3 {! Now it's a Slav Defence with two
extra tempi because after b2-b4 Black needs to play a6-a5 to
attack the pawn chain and he has already played a7-a6.} e6
7.b4 a5 8.Bb5 Be7 9.Nbd2 O-O 10.a3 Nh5 11.O-O Bd7 {Better
11...Nxf4 12.exf4 Qc7 13.g3 Bf6 14.Qb3 with some advantage}
12.Nb3 axb4 13.axb4 Rxa1 14.Qxa1 f6 {?!; 14...Nxf4 15.exf4 Qc7
16.Bxc6 Bxc6 17.Ne5 Be8 18.Nd4} 15.Bd6 {The Nh5 is very bad
now.} Bxd6 {15...f5 16.Bxe7 Qxe7 17.Be2 Nf6 18.b5 Nd8 19.c4}
16.cxd6 e5 17.Qd1 {!} Be6 18.Nc5 Bf7 {18...Qxd6 19.Nxb7 Qc7
20.Nc5 Qd6 21.Nxe6 Qxe6 22.Bxc6 Qxc6 23.g4} 19.g4 {Winning a
piece} Qxd6 20.gxh5 b6 21.Ne4 Qc7 22.Ng3 1-0
