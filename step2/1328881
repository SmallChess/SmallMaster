1. e4 {Notes by J. Lowenthal} d5 {A move that staunton adopted
against Lowenthal at the Birmingham meeting, but one that we
cannot at all recommend.} 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qd8 4. d4 e6
{Already Black's game is crampd. this shuts in his queen's
bishop.} 5. Nf3 Bd6 6. Bd3 Ne7 7. O-O h6 8. Be3 c6 9. Ne5
{Enabling him at once to throw up the f-pawn; a move that, as
we have before remarked, Mr Morphy takes the earliest
opportunity of making.} Nd7 10. f4 Nf6 11. Ne4 Nf5 12. Bf2 Bc7
13. c3 Nd5 14. Qf3 Qe7 15. Rae1 Bxe5 16. dxe5 {Better than
taking with the f-pawn, as now he can either play Bc5 or g4
with effect, and it is impossible to stop both attacks.} h5
17. Bc5 Qd8 18. Nd6+ Nxd6 19. Bxd6 {The bishop thus posted
looks invincible.} g6 20. Qg3 Ne7 21. Rd1 Bd7 22. Rd2 h4
23. Qg4 Nf5 24. Bxf5 exf5 {More judicious than capturing with
the g-pawn as Qg7 would have proved an embarrasing reply.}
25. Qf3 Qb6+ 26. Kh1 O-O-O 27. c4 {We should have preferred
playing h3; an examination of the position will show that it
was only through being permitted to plat ...h3 that black
gained the chance of drawing.} h3 28. g3 Be6 29. Qc3 Rd7
30. Rfd1 c5 31. Kg1 Rhd8 32. Qa3 a6 33. Bxc5 Qc6 34. Bd6 f6
35. Rd5 {A most ingenious conception, and one that would have
insured victory, had not his king be so exposed that he could
not exchange off the rooks when he desired it.} Bxd5 36. Rxd5
Rxd6 37. exd6 Kb8 38. Qd3 Rxd6 39. Qd2 Rxd5 40. cxd5 Qc5+
