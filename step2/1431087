1.d4 {Notes by GM Ray Keene} d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.Nc3 dxc4
5.a4 Bf5 6.Ne5 e6 7.f3 c5 {This is unusual. More common is 7
... Bb4 which can lead to great complications after 8 e4
Bxe4.} 8.e4 Bg6 {Again Black has a more complex alternative
available with 8 ... cxd4 but Kramnik is determined to play
quietly.} 9.Be3 cxd4 10.Qxd4 Qxd4 11.Bxd4 Nfd7 12.Nxd7 Nxd7
13.Bxc4 a6 14.Ke2 Rg8 {This is necessary in order to develop
his f8-bishop. White is a long way ahead in development and,
optically at least, his position looks promising. However,
Topalov proves unable to convert this into any more concrete.}

look attractive but they don't really get anywhere.} Bc5
