1. e4 {Notes by Morphy} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. b4 {The
game before us is the first in which that most beautiful of
openings, the "Evans Gambit", occurs between these two
distinguished players. M'donnell had for some time been
familiar with the attack, having analyzed this debut with its
originator, Captain Evans. Labourdonnais, on the other hand,
was comparitavely unacquainted with this new style of play,
and although unfortunate in the first encounter deserves great
credit for the skill and patience with which he elaborated the
defence in subsequent games.} Bxb4 5. c3 Ba5 {Our readers are
all aware that there has long existed a difference of opinion
among good players as to the relative advantages of 5...Ba5
and ...Bc5. The latter move, in our opinion affords a more
satisfactory defence than any at the second player's choice.}
6. O-O {This was considered White's best play until after the
death of both these illustrious chess athletes. Later analysis
has proved 6.d4 followed by 7.O-O, etc, to be the strongest
line of attack at this juncture. } d6 {6...Nf6 is the correct
move. If, in reply, White advanced 7.d4, Black replies with
...O-O, and will preserve a safe and well developed game. }
7. d4 Bb6 {Black should have captured pawn with pawn before
retreating the bishop to b6. } 8. dxe5 Bg4 9. Bb5 Bxf3
10. Qxf3 dxe5 11. Qg3 Qf6 12. Bg5 Qe6 13. Na3 Nf6 14. Bxf6
gxf6 {To have retaken with queen would have been better
play. Suppose 14...Qxf6 15.Nc4 O-O 16.Bxc6 Qxc6 17.Nxe5 Qe6
(best) The game is quite even. Had Black, in this variation,
captured the king's pawn with queen on his last move, he must
have lost the exchange as White would have moved 18.Nd7. }
15. Rad1 Bc5 16. Qg7 Ke7 {A mistake which costs the
exchange. He should have moved the attacked rook to f8. }

been played to e6, White would equally have won by 30.Rd5. }
